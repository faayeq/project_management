      "content": "Preface\nEach time work begins on a new edition of The Standard for Project Management\nand the PMBOK® Guide, there is an opportunity to consider global perspectives on\nchanges in project management and the approaches used for realizing benefits and value\nfrom project outputs. In the time between every edition, a world of change has occurred.\nSome organizations have ceased to exist, and new organizations have emerged. Older\ntechnologies have reached end of life while technologies offering completely new\ncapabilities have evolved. People who continue in the workforce have advanced their\nthinking, skills, and capabilities as new entrants focus on quickly understanding their\nprofessional language, building their skills, developing their business acumen, and\ncontributing to the objectives of their employers.\nEven in the midst of such changes, though, there are fundamental concepts and\nconstructs that remain in place. The understanding that collective thinking produces\nmore holistic solutions than the thoughts of one individual continues. And the fact that\norganizations use projects as a vehicle for delivering a unique result or output endures.\nCUSTOMER- AND END-USER-CENTERED DESIGN\nWhile the Sixth Edition of the PMBOK® Guide was under development and\nthroughout development of this Seventh Edition, PMI has actively engaged with a broad\nrange of global stakeholders on their experiences with using The Standard for Project\nManagement and the PMBOK® Guide. These engagements have included:\nOnline surveys to representative samples of PMI stakeholders;\nFocus groups with PMO leaders, project managers, agile practitioners, project\nteam members, and educators and trainers; and\nInteractive workshops with practitioners at various PMI events around the globe.\nThe feedback and inputs collectively emphasized four key points:\nMaintain and enhance the credibility and relevance of the PMBOK® Guide."

What software can\nenable continues to change as artificial intelligence, cloud-based capabilities, and new\nbusiness models drive innovation and new ways of working. Transformed\norganizational models have yielded new project work and team structures, the need for\na broad range of approaches to project and product delivery, and a stronger focus on\noutcomes rather than deliverables. Individual contributors can join project teams from\nanywhere in the world, serve in a broader array of roles, and enable new ways of\nthinking and working collaboratively. These changes and more have created this\nopportunity to reconsider perspectives to support the continued evolution of The\nStandard for Project Management and the PMBOK® Guide.\nSUMMARY OF CHANGES\nSince 1987, The Standard for Project Management has represented a process-\nbased standard.

      "content": "Guide aligned the project management discipline and function around a collection of\nbusiness processes. Those business processes enabled consistent and predictable\npractices:\nThat could be documented;\nThrough which performance against the processes could be assessed; and\nThrough which improvements to the process could be made to maximize\nefficiency and minimize threats.\nWhile effective in supporting good practice, process-based standards are\nprescriptive by their very nature. With project management evolving more rapidly than\never before, the process-based orientation of past editions cannot be maintained in a\nmanner conducive to reflecting the full value delivery landscape. Therefore, this edition\nshifts to a principles-based standard to support effective project management and to\nfocus more on intended outcomes rather than deliverables.\nA global community of practitioners from different industries and organizations, in\ndifferent roles, and working on different types of projects have developed and/or\nprovided feedback on drafts of the standard as it has evolved for this edition. In\naddition, the PMBOK® Guide – Seventh Edition coleaders and staff reviewed other\nbodies of knowledge and works focused on project management to identify principle\nconcepts embedded in those texts. These combined efforts showed strong alignment and\nsupported the validation that the guiding principles in this edition of the standard apply\nacross the spectrum of project management.\nTo date, the global project management community has embraced the shift of this\nstandard toward a set of principle statements. The principle statements capture and\nsummarize generally accepted objectives for the practice of project management and its\ncore functions. The principle statements provide broad parameters within which project\nteams can operate and offer many ways to remain aligned with the intent of the\nprinciples.\nUsing these principle statements, PMI can reflect effective management of projects\nacross the full value delivery landscape: predictive to adaptive and everything in\nbetween. This principles-based approach is also consistent with the evolution of The\nStandard for Program Management (Third and Fourth Editions) and The Standard for\nPortfolio Management – Fourth Edition. The Standard for Risk Management in\nPortfolios, Programs, and Projects and Benefits Realization Management: A Practice\nGuide represent new standard products intentionally developed with a principles-based\nfocus by global teams of subject matter experts."

      "content": "Nothing in this edition of The Standard for Project Management or A Guide to the\nProject Management Body of Knowledge negates alignment with the process-based\napproach of past editions. Many organizations and practitioners continue to find that\napproach useful for guiding their project management capabilities, aligning their\nmethodologies, and evaluating their project management capabilities. That approach\nremains relevant in the context of this new edition.\nAnother significant change with this edition of the PMBOK® Guide is a systems\nview of project management. This shift begins with a systems view of value delivery as\npart of The Standard for Project Management and continues with the presentation of\nthe PMBOK® Guide content. A systems focus for value delivery changes the\nperspective from one of governing portfolios, programs, and projects to focusing on the\nvalue chain that links those and other business capabilities to advancing organizational\nstrategy, value, and business objectives. In the context of project management, The\nStandard for Project Management and the PMBOK® Guide emphasize that projects do\nnot simply produce outputs, but more importantly, enable those outputs to drive\noutcomes that ultimately deliver value to the organization and its stakeholders.\nThis systems view reflects a shift from the Knowledge Areas in past editions of the\nPMBOK® Guide to eight project performance domains. A performance domain is a\ngroup of related activities that are critical for the effective delivery of project\noutcomes. Collectively, the performance domains represent a project management\nsystem of interactive, interrelated, and interdependent management capabilities that\nwork in unison to achieve desired project outcomes. As the performance domains\ninteract and react to each other, change occurs. Project teams continuously review,\ndiscuss, adapt, and respond to such changes with the whole system in mind—not just the\nspecific performance domain in which the change occurred. Aligned with the concept of\na system for value delivery in The Standard for Project Management, teams evaluate\neffective performance in each performance domain through outcomes-focused measures,\nrather than through adherence to processes or the production of artifacts, plans, etc.\nPrevious editions of the PMBOK® Guide emphasized the importance of tailoring\nthe project management approach to the unique characteristics of each project and its\ncontext. The Sixth Edition specifically incorporated considerations to help project\nteams think about how to tailor their approach to project management. That content was\nincluded in the front matter of each of the Knowledge Areas and provided\nconsiderations for all types of project environments. This edition further expands upon\nthat work with a dedicated section on Tailoring in the PMBOK® Guide.\nA new section on Models, Methods, and Artifacts provides a high-level grouping of\nmodels, methods, and artifacts that support project management. This section maintains\nlinkages to tools, techniques, and outputs from previous editions that support project\nmanagement without prescribing when, how, or which tools teams should use."

An outcome is the end result or consequence of a process or a project.\nFocusing on outcomes, choices, and decisions emphasizes the long-range performance\nof the project. The outcomes create benefits, which are gains realized by the\norganization. Benefits, in turn, create value, which is something of worth, importance,\nor usefulness.\n2.1.2 INFORMATION FLOW\nA value delivery system works most effectively when information and feedback are\nshared consistently among all components, keeping the system aligned with strategy and\nattuned to the environment."

Governance systems provide a\nframework with functions and processes that guide activities. A governance framework\ncan include elements of oversight, control, value assessment, integration among\ncomponents, and decision-making capabilities.\nGovernance systems provide an integrated structure for evaluating changes, issues,\nand risks associated with the environment and any component in the value delivery\nsystem.

In\nsome organizations, a project management office might support programs and projects\nwithin a portfolio. Project governance includes defining the authority to approve\nchanges and make other business decisions related to the project. Project governance is\naligned with program and/or organizational governance.\n2.3 FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECTS\nPeople drive project delivery. They do so by fulfilling functions necessary for the\nproject to run effectively and efficiently. Functions related to the project can be fulfilled\nby one person, by a group of people, or combined into defined roles.\nCoordinating a collective work effort is extremely important to the success of any\nproject. There are different types of coordination suitable for different contexts. Some\nprojects benefit from decentralized coordination in which project team members self-\norganize and self-manage. Other projects benefit from centralized coordination with the\nleadership and guidance of a designated project manager or similar role. Some projects\nwith centralized coordination can also benefit from including self-organized project\nteams for portions of the work. Regardless of how coordination takes place, supportive\nleadership models and meaningful, continuous engagements between project teams and\nother stakeholders underpin successful outcomes.\nRegardless of how projects are coordinated, the collective effort of the project team\ndelivers the outcomes, benefits, and value. The project team may be supported by\nadditional functions depending on the deliverables, industry, organization, and other\nvariables. Sections 2.3.1 through 2.3.8 provide examples of functions that are often\nfound on projects, though these are not a comprehensive list. In addition to these\nfunctions, other functions may be necessary to enable project deliverables that produce\nthe desired outcomes. The needs of the project, organization, and environment influence\nwhich functions are used on a project and how those functions are carried out.\n2.3.1 PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION\nPeople in this function help the project team achieve the project objectives,\ntypically by orchestrating the work of the project. The specifics of how this function is\ncarried out within the project team can vary among organizations, but can include\nleading the planning, monitoring, and controlling activities. In some organizations, this\nfunction may involve some evaluation and analysis activities as part of pre-project\nactivities. This function includes monitoring and working to improve the health, safety,\nand overall well-being of project team members."

      "content": "Coordination includes consulting with executive and business unit leaders on ideas\nfor advancing objectives, improving project performance, or meeting customer needs. It\ncan also include assisting in business analysis, tendering and contract negotiations, and\nbusiness case development.\nOversight can be involved in follow-on activities related to benefits realization and\nsustainment after the project deliverables are finalized but before formal closure of the\nproject. This function can support portfolios and programs within which the project is\ninitiated. Ultimately, the function is tailored to fit the organization.\n2.3.2 PRESENT OBJECTIVES AND FEEDBACK\nPeople in this function contribute perspectives, insights, and clear direction from\ncustomers and end users. The customer and end user are not always synonymous. For\nthe purpose of this standard, the customer is defined as the individual or group who has\nrequested or is funding the project. The end user is the individual or group who will\nexperience the direct use of the project deliverable.\nProjects need clear direction from customers and end users regarding project\nrequirements, outcomes, and expectations. In adaptive and hybrid project environments,\nthe need for ongoing feedback is greater because the project teams are exploring and\ndeveloping product elements within specific increments. In some project environments,\nthe customer or end user engages with the project team for periodic review and\nfeedback. In some projects, a representative of the customer or client participates on the\nproject team. The customer and end user input and feedback needs are determined by\nthe nature of the project and the guidance or direction required.\n2.3.3 FACILITATE AND SUPPORT\nThe function of facilitation and support may be closely related to providing\noversight and coordination, depending on the nature of the project. The work involves\nencouraging project team member participation, collaboration, and a shared sense of\nresponsibility for the work output. Facilitation helps the project team create consensus\naround solutions, resolve conflicts, and make decisions. Facilitation is also required to\ncoordinate meetings and contribute in an unbiased way to the advancement of project\nobjectives.\nSupporting people through change and helping address obstacles that can prevent\nsuccess is also required. This can include evaluating performance and providing\nindividuals and project teams with feedback to help them learn, adapt, and improve."

Work can be full time or\npart time for the duration of the project or for a limited period, and the work can be\ncolocated or virtual, depending on the environmental factors. Some work can be highly\nspecialized, while other work can be done by project team members who have broad\nskill sets.\nGaining insights from cross-functional project team members representing different\nparts of the organization can provide a mix of internal perspectives, establish alliances\nwith key business units, and encourage project team members to act as change agents\nwithin their functional areas. This work can extend into support functions (during or\nafter the project) as the project deliverables are implemented or transitioned into\noperations.\n2.3.5 APPLY EXPERTISE\nPeople in this function provide the knowledge, vision, and expertise in a specific\nsubject for a project. They offer advice and support throughout the organization, and\ncontribute to the project team's learning process and work accuracy. These people can\nbe external to the organization or can be internal project team members. They can be\nrequired for the whole project or during a specific time frame.\n2.3.6 PROVIDE BUSINESS DIRECTION AND INSIGHT\nPeople in this function guide and clarify the direction of the project or product\noutcome. This function involves prioritizing the requirements or backlog items based on\nbusiness value, dependencies, and technical or operational risk. People in this function\nprovide feedback to project teams and set direction for the next increment or element to\nbe developed or delivered. The function involves interacting with other stakeholders,\ncustomers, and their project teams to define the product direction. The goal is to\nmaximize the value of the project deliverable.\nIn adaptive and hybrid environments, direction and insight can be provided using a\nspecific cadence. In predictive environments, there can be designated checkpoints for\npresentation of and feedback on project progress. In some instances, business direction\ncan interact with funding and resourcing functions.\n2.3.7 PROVIDE RESOURCES AND DIRECTION"

Internal and external environments can\ninfluence planning and other project activities. These influences can yield a favorable,\nunfavorable, or neutral impact on project characteristics, stakeholders, or project teams.\n2.4.1 INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT\nFactors internal to the organization can arise from the organization itself, a\nportfolio, a program, another project, or a combination of these. They include artifacts,\npractices, or internal knowledge. Knowledge includes lessons learned as well as\ncompleted artifacts from previous projects.

While portfolio, program, and product management are\nbeyond the scope of this standard, understanding each discipline and the relationships\nbetween them provides a useful context for projects whose deliverables are products.\nA product is an artifact that is produced, is quantifiable, and can be either an end\nitem itself or a component item. Product management involves the integration of people,\ndata, processes, and business systems to create, maintain, and develop a product or\nservice throughout its life cycle. The product life cycle is a series of phases that\nrepresents the evolution of a product, from introduction through growth, maturity, and to\nretirement.\nProduct management may initiate programs or projects at any point in the product\nlife cycle to create or enhance specific components, functions, or capabilities (see\nFigure 2-4). The initial product may begin as a deliverable of a program or project.\nThroughout its life cycle, a new program or project may add or improve specific\ncomponents, attributes, or capabilities that create additional value for customers and the\nsponsoring organization.

Professional standards and methodologies are often based\non principles. In some professions, principles serve as laws or rules, and are therefore\nprescriptive in nature. The principles of project management are not prescriptive in\nnature. They are intended to guide the behavior of people involved in projects. They are\nbroadly based so there are many ways individuals and organizations can maintain\nalignment with the principles.\nPrinciples can, but do not necessarily, reflect morals. A code of ethics is related to\nmorals. A code of ethics for a profession can be adopted by an individual or profession\nto establish expectations for moral conduct. The PMI Code of Ethics and Professional\nConduct [2] is based on four values that were identified as most important to the\nproject management community:\nResponsibility,\nRespect,\nFairness, and\nHonesty.\nThe 12 principles of project management are aligned with the values identified in\nthe PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. They do not follow the same\nformat, and they are not duplicative, rather the principles and the Code of Ethics are\ncomplementary.\nThe principles of project management were identified and developed by engaging a\nglobal community of project practitioners. The practitioners represent different\nindustries, cultural backgrounds, and organizations in different roles and with\nexperience in various types of projects. Multiple rounds of feedback resulted in 12\nprinciples that provide guidance for effective project management.\nBecause the principles of project management provide guidance, the degree of\napplication and the way in which they are applied are influenced by the context of the\norganization, project, deliverables, project team, stakeholders, and other factors. The\nprinciples are internally consistent, meaning that no principle contradicts any other"

The project justification is accompanied by a cost-benefit\nanalysis and assumptions.\nBusiness strategy. Business strategy is the reason for the project and all needs\nare related to the strategy to achieve the value.\nTogether, the business need, project justification, and business strategy, in addition\nto benefits and possible agreements, provide the project team with information that\nallows them to make informed decisions to meet or exceed the intended business value.\nDesired outcomes should be clearly described, iteratively assessed, and updated\nthroughout the project. During its life cycle, a project may undergo change and the\nproject team then adapts in response. The project team continuously evaluates project\nprogress and direction against the desired outputs, baselines, and business case to\nconfirm that the project remains aligned to the need and will deliver its intended\noutcomes. Alternatively, the business case is updated to capture an opportunity or\nminimize a problem identified by the project team and other stakeholders. If the project\nor its stakeholders are no longer aligned with the business need or if the project seems\nunlikely to provide the intended value, the organization may choose to terminate the\neffort.\nValue is the worth, importance, or usefulness of something. Value is subjective, in\nthe sense that the same concept can have different values for different people and\norganizations. This occurs because what is considered a benefit depends on\norganizational strategies, ranging from short-term financial gains, long-term gains, and\neven nonfinancial elements. Because all projects have a range of stakeholders, different\nvalues generated for each group of stakeholders have to be considered and balanced\nwith the whole, while placing a priority on the customer perspective.\nWithin the context of some projects, there may be different forms of value\nengineering that maximize value to the customer, to the performing organization, or other\nstakeholders. An example of this includes delivering the required functionality and level\nof quality with an acceptable risk exposure, while using as few resources as possible,\nand by avoiding waste. Sometimes, especially in adaptive projects that do not have a\nfixed, up-front scope, the project team can optimize value by working with the customer\nto determine which features are worth investment and which may not be valuable\nenough to be added to the output."

For example, customers may want a\nspecific software solution because they think that the solution resolves the business\nneed for higher productivity. The software is the output of the project, but the software\nitself does not enable the productivity outcome that is intended. In this case, adding a\nnew deliverable of training and coaching on the use of the software can enable a better\nproductivity outcome. If the project's output fails to enable higher productivity,\nstakeholders may feel that the project has failed. Thus, project teams and other\nstakeholders understand both the deliverable and the intended outcome from the\ndeliverable.\nThe value contribution of project work could be a short- or long-term measure.\nBecause value contribution may be mixed with contributions from operational\nactivities, it may be difficult to isolate. When the project is a component of a program,\nevaluation of value at the program level may also be necessary to properly direct the\nproject. A reliable evaluation of value should consider the whole context and the entire\nlife cycle of the project's output. While value is realized over time, effective processes\ncan enable early benefit realization. With efficient and effective implementation, project\nteams may demonstrate or achieve such outcomes as prioritized delivery, better\ncustomer service, or an improved work environment.

Taking a holistic view, a project is a multifaceted entity that exists in\ndynamic circumstances, exhibiting the characteristics of a system. Project teams should\nacknowledge this holistic view of a project, seeing the project as a system with its own\nworking parts.\nA project works within other larger systems, and a project deliverable may become\npart of a larger system to realize benefits. For example, projects may be part of a\nprogram which, in turn, may also be part of a portfolio. These interconnected structures\nare known as a system of systems. Project teams balance inside/out and outside/in\nperspectives to support alignment across the system of systems.\nThe project may also have subsystems that are required to integrate effectively to\ndeliver the intended outcome. For example, when individual project teams develop\nseparate components of a deliverable, all components should integrate effectively. This\nrequires project teams to interact and align subsystem work on a regular basis.\nSystems thinking also considers timing elements of systems, such as what the project\ndelivers or enables over time. For example, if project deliverables are released\nincrementally, each increment expands the cumulative outcomes or capabilities of\nprevious versions. Project teams should think beyond the end of the project to the\noperational state of the project's deliverable, so that intended outcomes are realized.\nAs projects unfold, internal and external conditions are continuously changing.

With systems\nthinking, including constant attention to internal and external conditions, the project team\ncan navigate a wide spectrum of changes and impacts to keep the project in agreement\nwith the relevant stakeholders.\nSystems thinking also applies to how the project team views itself and its\ninteractions within the project system. The project system often brings together a\ndiverse project team engaged in working for a common objective. This diversity brings\nvalue to project teams, but they need to consider how to leverage those differences\neffectively, so that the project team works cohesively. For example, if a government\nagency contracts with a private company for development of a new technology, the\ndevelopment team may consist of project team members from both organizations. Those\nproject team members may have assumptions, ways of working, and mental models\nrelated to how they function within their home organization. In this new project system,\nwhich combines the cultures of a private company and a government agency, the project\nteam members can establish a synthesized team culture that creates a common vision,\nlanguage, and toolset.

Of all\nthese, no single leadership style has proven to be the universally best or recommended\napproach. Instead, effective leadership is shown when it best fits a given situation. For\nexample:\nIn moments of chaos, directive action creates more clarity and momentum than\ncollaborative problem solving.\nFor environments with highly competent and engaged staff, empowered\ndelegation elicits more productivity than centralized coordination.\nWhen senior managers suffer conflict over priorities, neutral facilitation helps more\nthan detailed recommendations. Effective leadership skill is grown. It can be learned\nand developed so that it becomes a professional asset to the individual, as well as a\nbenefit to the project and its stakeholders. High-performing projects show a pervasive\npattern of continuous improvement down to the personal level.

Tailoring is the deliberate adaptation of approach,\ngovernance, and processes to make them more suitable for the given environment and\nthe work at hand. Project teams tailor the appropriate framework that will enable the\nflexibility to consistently produce positive outcomes within the context of the life cycle\nof the project. The business environment, team size, degree of uncertainty, and\ncomplexity of the project all factor into how project systems are tailored. Project\nsystems can be tailored with a holistic perspective, including the consideration of\ninterrelated complexities. Tailoring aims to maximize value, manage constraints, and\nimprove performance by using “just enough” processes, methods, templates, and\nartifacts to achieve the desired outcome from the project.\nTogether with the PMO and considering governance, project teams discuss and\ndecide on the delivery approach and resources required for producing outcomes on a\nproject-by-project basis. This includes the selection of the processes to use,\ndevelopment approach, methods, and artifacts needed to deliver the project outcomes.\nTailoring decisions can be an implicit action of accepting an established methodology.\nConversely, tailoring can be an explicit action of selecting and mixing specific elements\nto suit the unique characteristics of the project and the project environment. Tailoring is\nnecessary to some degree in every project, because each project exists in a particular\ncontext.\nProjects are often unique, even when the deliverable of the project does not seem\nunique. This is because project contexts differ in that the organization, its customers, its\nchannels, and its environment are dynamic elements. Those changes and ongoing\nlearning may cause project teams to use or develop different methods or approaches in\npursuit of success. The project team should examine the unique set of conditions for\neach project, so that they can determine the most appropriate methods of producing the\ndesired outcomes.\nAn existing methodology or common way of working can inform the way in which a\nproject is tailored. A methodology is a system of practices, techniques, procedures, and\nrules used by those who work in a discipline. Project teams may be required to assume\nthe methodology of the parent organization. That is, the project team adopts a system of\nprocesses, governance, methods, and templates that provide guidance on how to run the\nproject. While this provides a degree of consistency to projects within an organization,\nthe methodology itself may still need tailoring to suit each project. Organizational\npolicies and procedures prescribe authorized boundaries within which the project team\ncan tailor."

Quality includes the ability to satisfy the customer's\nstated or implied needs. The product, service, or result of a project (referred to here as\ndeliverables) is measured for the quality of both the conformance to acceptance criteria\nand fitness for use.\nQuality may have several different dimensions, including but not limited to the\nfollowing:\nPerformance. Does the deliverable function as the project team and other\nstakeholders intended?\nConformity. Is the deliverable fit for use, and does it meet the specifications?\nReliability. Does the deliverable produce consistent metrics each time it is\nperformed or produced?\nResilience. Is the deliverable able to cope with unforeseen failures and quickly\nrecover?"

Does the deliverable produce a positive impact on economic,\nsocial, and environmental parameters?\nProject teams measure quality using metrics and acceptance criteria based on\nrequirements. A requirement is a condition or capability that is necessary to be present\nin a product, service, or result to satisfy a need. Requirements, either explicit or\nimplicit, may come from stakeholders, a contract, organizational policies, standards, or\nregulatory bodies, or a combination of these. Quality is closely linked to the product\nacceptance criteria, as described in the statement of work or other design documents.\nThese criteria should be updated as experimentation and prioritization occur and\nvalidated as part of the acceptance process.\nQuality is also relevant to the project approaches and activities used to produce the\nproject's deliverables. While project teams evaluate the quality of a deliverable through\ninspection and testing, project activities and processes are assessed through reviews\nand audits. In both instances, quality activities may focus on detection and prevention of\nerrors and defects.\nThe objective of quality activities is to help ensure that what is delivered meets the\nobjectives of the customer and other relevant stakeholders in the most straightforward\npath. The intention is to minimize the waste of resources and maximize the probability\nof attaining the desired outcome. This results in:\nMoving the deliverables to the point of delivery quickly, and\nPreventing defects in the deliverables or identifying them early to avoid or\nreduce the need for rework and scrap.\nThe objective of quality activities is the same whether dealing with an up-front,\nwell-defined set of requirements or a set of requirements that are progressively\nelaborated and incrementally delivered.\nQuality management processes and practices help produce deliverables and\noutcomes that meet project objectives and align to the expectations, uses, and\nacceptance criteria expressed by the organization and relevant stakeholders.

Complexity is a\ncharacteristic of a project or its environment that is difficult to manage due to human\nbehavior, system behavior, and ambiguity. The nature and number of the interactions\ndetermine the degree of complexity in a project. Complexity emerges from project\nelements, interactions between project elements, and interactions with other systems\nand the project environment. Though complexity cannot be controlled, project teams can\nmodify their activities to address impacts that occur as a result of complexity.\nProject teams often cannot foresee complexity emerging because it is the result of\nmany interactions such as risks, dependencies, events, or relationships. Alternatively, a\nfew causes may converge to produce a single complex effect, which makes isolating a\nspecific cause of complexity difficult.\nProject complexity occurs as the result of individual elements within the project and\nproject system as a whole. For example, complexity within a project may be amplified\nwith a greater number or diversity of stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies,\ninternational financial institutions, multiple vendors, numerous specialty subcontractors,\nor local communities. These stakeholders can have a significant impact on the\ncomplexity of a project, both individually and collectively.\nSome of the more common sources of complexity are:\nHuman behavior. Human behavior is the interplay of conduct, demeanors,\nattitudes, and experience of people. Human behavior can also contribute to\ncomplexity by introducing elements of subjectivity such as personal agendas that\nconflict with the project's goals and objectives. Stakeholders located in remote\nlocations may have different time zones, speak different languages, and have\ndifferent cultural norms.\nSystem behavior. System behavior is the result of dynamic interdependencies\nwithin and among project elements. For example, the integration of different\ntechnology systems may cause threats that could impact project outcomes and\nsuccess. The interactions among components of the project system may lead to\ninterconnected risk, create emerging or unforeseeable issues, and produce\nunclear and disproportional cause-and-effect relationships.\nUncertainty and ambiguity. Ambiguity is a state of being unclear, of not\nknowing what to expect or how to comprehend a situation. Ambiguity can arise\nfrom having many options or a lack of clarity on the optimal choice. Unclear or\nmisleading events, emerging issues, or subjective situations can also lead to\nambiguity."

Uncertainty deals with the probabilities of\nalternative actions, reactions, and outcomes. Uncertainty includes unknown\nunknowns and black swans, which are emerging factors that are completely\noutside of existing knowledge or experience.\nWithin a complex environment, uncertainty and ambiguity can combine to blur\ncausal relationships to the point where probabilities and impacts are ill defined.\nIt becomes difficult to reduce uncertainty and ambiguity to the point where\nrelationships can be well defined and therefore addressed effectively.\nTechnological innovation. Technological innovation can cause disruption to\nproducts, services, ways of working, processes, tools, techniques, procedures,\nand more. The introduction of desktop computing and social media are examples\nof technological innovations that have fundamentally changed the way project\nwork is performed. New technology, along with the uncertainty of how that\ntechnology will be used, contributes to complexity. Innovation has the potential to\nhelp move projects toward a solution, or to disrupt the project when associated\nuncertainties are not defined, leading to increased complexity.\nComplexity may emerge and impact the project in any area and at any point in the\nproject life cycle. Project teams can identify elements of complexity throughout the\nproject by continually looking at the project component as well as the project as a\nwhole for signs of complexity. Knowledge of systems thinking, complex adaptive\nsystems, experience from past project work, experimentation, and continuous learning\nrelated to system interaction leads to the project team's increased ability to navigate\ncomplexity when it emerges. Being vigilant for indications of complexity allows project\nteams to adapt their approaches and plans to navigate potential disruption to effective\nproject delivery.\n3.10 OPTIMIZE RISK RESPONSES"

Identified risks may or may not materialize in\na project. Project teams endeavor to identify and evaluate known and emergent risks,\nboth internal and external to the project, throughout the life cycle.\nProject teams seek to maximize positive risks (opportunities) and decrease\nexposure to negative risks (threats). Threats may result in issues such as delay, cost\noverrun, technical failure, performance shortfall, or loss of reputation. Opportunities\ncan lead to benefits such as reduced time and cost, improved performance, increased\nmarket share, or enhanced reputation.\nProject teams also monitor the overall project risk. Overall project risk is the effect\nof uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall risk arises from all sources of\nuncertainty, including individual risks, and represents the exposure of the stakeholders\nto the implications of variations in project outcome, both positive and negative.\nManagement of overall project risk aims to keep project risk exposure within an\nacceptable range.

The risk appetite and risk threshold inform\nhow the project team navigates risk in a project.\nEffective and appropriate risk responses can reduce individual and overall project\nthreats and increase individual and overall opportunities. Project teams should\nconsistently identify potential risk responses with the following characteristics in mind:\nAppropriate and timely to the significance of the risk,\nCost effective,\nRealistic within the project context,\nAgreed to by relevant stakeholders, and\nOwned by a responsible person.\nRisks can exist within the enterprise, portfolio, program, project, and product. The\nproject may be a component of a program in which the risk can potentially enhance or\ndiminish benefits realization and, therefore, value. The project may be a component of a\nportfolio of related or unrelated work in which the risk can potentially enhance or\ndiminish overall value of the portfolio and realization of business objectives.\nOrganizations and project teams that employ consistent risk evaluation, planning,\nand proactive risk implementation often find the effort to be less costly than reacting to\nissues when the risk materializes.\nMore information on risk management may be found in The Standard for Risk\nManagement in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects [3].\n3.11 EMBRACE ADAPTABILITY AND RESILIENCY"

The combined\nattributes of adaptability and resiliency in the project team's approach to a project help\nthe project accommodate impacts and thrive. Adaptability refers to the ability to\nrespond to changing conditions. Resiliency consists of two complementary traits: the\nability to absorb impacts and the ability to recover quickly from a setback or failure.\nBoth adaptability and resiliency are helpful characteristics for anyone working on\nprojects.\nA project rarely performs exactly as initially planned. Projects are influenced by\ninternal and external factors—new requirements, issues, stakeholder influences, among\nother factors—which exist in a system of interactions. Some elements within a project\nmay fail or fall short of expectations, requiring the project team to regroup, rethink, and\nreplan. On an infrastructure project, for example, a court decision during project\nexecution could change the designs and plans. In a technology project, a computerized\nmodel of the technology might show that the components work together properly, but the\nreal-world application fails. In both cases, the project team will need to address the\nsituation in order to move the project forward. The view that projects should hold firm\nto plans and commitments made during the early stages, even after new or unforeseen\nfactors emerge, is not beneficial to stakeholders, including customers and end users, as\nthis limits the potential for generating value. However, adapting should be done with a\nholistic view, such as a proper change control process, to avoid problems such as scope\ncreep.

It is different from project change\ncontrol, which is a process whereby modifications to documents, deliverables, or\nbaselines associated with the project are identified and documented, and then are\napproved or rejected.\nChange in an organization can originate from internal sources, such as the need for a\nnew capability or in response to a performance gap. Change can also originate from\nexternal sources such as technological advances, demographic changes, or\nsocioeconomic pressures. Any type of change involves some level of adaptability or\nassimilation by the group experiencing the change as well as the industries with which\nthe group interacts.\nChange may be implemented by and have consequences for stakeholders. Enabling\nstakeholder change is part of facilitating the project to provide the required deliverable\nas well as the intended outcome.\nEnabling change in an organization can be challenging. Some people may seem\ninherently resistant to change or risk averse, and environments may display a\nconservative culture, among other reasons.

Even when stakeholders unanimously agree that change will produce more\nvalue or enhance outcomes, they often still have difficulty working through the actions\nthat will deliver enhanced benefits.

Relationship between Project Management Principles and Project Performance Domains\n1.3 CHANGES TO THE PMBOK® GUIDE\nThis edition of the PMBOK® Guide focuses on delivering outcomes regardless of\nthe approach used by the project team. However, project practitioners using the\nPMBOK® Guide also benefit from some level of understanding of how to deliver\nprojects.\nThis edition is very different from the inputs, tools/techniques, and outputs (ITTOs)\nfrom previous editions of the PMBOK® Guide. In the previous editions, the ITTOs\nsupported implementation of various processes used in project management. The shift\nfrom a process-based standard to one based on principles necessitates a different\napproach for thinking about the various aspects of project management. Thus, the\nproject performance domains represent a group of related activities that are critical for\nthe effective delivery of project outcomes. There are eight project performance domains\nin this guide.\nTailoring is the deliberate adaptation of the project management approach,\ngovernance, and processes to make them more suitable for the given environment and\nthe work at hand. The tailoring process is driven by the guiding project management\nprinciples, organizational values, and organizational culture.\nIn embracing the full spectrum of project approaches, this edition of the PMBOK®\nGuide recognizes that no publication can capture every tool, technique, or practice that\nproject teams might use. Therefore, this edition presents an array of commonly used\nmodels, methods, and artifacts that project practitioners can use to accomplish their\nwork.\n1.4 RELATIONSHIP TO PMIstandards+\nInformation in this guide is further elaborated on PMIstandards+, PMI's digital\ncontent platform. The digital platform encompasses current and emerging practices and\nother useful information related to PMI's library of standards products. It also includes\npractical examples of application within various contexts and industry segments.\nPMIstandards+ evolved in response to advances and changes in how projects can be\ndelivered. It offers a dynamic body of knowledge with real-time access and in-depth\ninformation that is aligned to PMI standards and carefully vetted by a panel of subject\nmatter experts representing a wide range of expertise."

Project performance domains are interactive,\ninterrelated, and interdependent areas of focus that work in unison to achieve desired\nproject outcomes. There are eight project performance domains:\nStakeholders,\nTeam,\nDevelopment Approach and Life Cycle,\nPlanning,\nProject Work,\nDelivery,\nMeasurement, and\nUncertainty.\nTogether the performance domains form a unified whole. In this way, the\nperformance domains operate as an integrated system, with each performance domain\nbeing interdependent of the other performance domains to enable successful delivery of\nthe project and its intended outcomes.\nPerformance domains run concurrently throughout the project, regardless of how\nvalue is delivered (frequently, periodically, or at the end of the project). For example,\nproject leads spend time focused on stakeholders, the project team, the project life\ncycle, the project work, and so forth, from the outset of the project to its closure. These\nareas of focus are not addressed as siloed efforts because they overlap and\ninterconnect. The ways in which the performance domains relate are different for each\nproject, but they are present in every project.\nThe specific activities undertaken within each of the performance domains are\ndetermined by the context of the organization, the project, deliverables, the project\nteam, stakeholders, and other factors. The performance domains are presented in the\nfollowing sections without specific weighting or order."

Stakeholder engagement activities start before\nor when the project starts and continue throughout the project.\nFigure 2-3. Navigating Effective Stakeholder Engagement\nDefining and sharing a clear vision at the start of the project can enable good\nrelationships and alignment throughout the project.

Some stakeholders are easy to identify,\nsuch as the customer, sponsor, project team, end users, and so forth, but others can be\ndifficult to identify when they are not directly connected to the project.\n2.1.1.2 Understand and Analyze\nOnce stakeholders are identified, the project manager and the project team should\nseek to understand stakeholders’ feelings, emotions, beliefs, and values. These elements\ncan lead to additional threats or opportunities for the project outcomes. They can also\nchange quickly, and as such, understanding and analyzing stakeholders is an ongoing\naction.\nRelated to understanding the project stakeholders is the need to analyze aspects of\neach stakeholder's position on and perspective of the project. Analyzing stakeholders\nconsiders several stakeholder aspects, such as:\nPower,\nImpact,\nAttitude,\nBeliefs,\nExpectations,\nDegree of influence,\nProximity to the project,\nInterest in the project, and\nOther aspects surrounding stakeholder interaction with the project.\nThis information helps the project team consider interactions that may influence the\nmotivations, actions, and behaviors of stakeholders. In addition to individual analysis,\nthe project team should consider how stakeholders interact with each other, as they\noften form alliances that help or hinder the project's objectives. For example, if the\nproject team believes a key business manager is highly influential but has negative\nperceptions related to the project, they can explore how to detect the business manager's\nperceptions and respond appropriately as the project unfolds. In all cases, the analysis\nwork should be held in confidence by the project team since the information could be\nmisinterpreted outside the context for the analysis."

In addition to identifying and analyzing new\nstakeholders, there is an opportunity to assess whether the current engagement strategy\nis effective or if it needs to be adjusted. Therefore, the amount and effectiveness of\nstakeholder engagement is monitored throughout the project.\nThe degree of stakeholder satisfaction can often be determined by having a\nconversation with stakeholders to gauge their satisfaction with the project deliverables\nand the overall management of the project.

Such arrangements often require more up-front work to\nestablish a “one team” mindset, ensure project team members understand how\neveryone contributes to the project, and establish other enablers that integrate\nskills, capabilities, and processes.\n2.2.2 PROJECT TEAM CULTURE\nEach project team develops its own team culture. The project team's culture may be\nestablished deliberately by developing project team norms, or informally through the\nbehaviors and actions of its project team members. The project team culture operates\nwithin the organization's culture but reflects the project team's individual ways of\nworking and interacting.\nHuman beings have a set of biases, some of them unconscious and some of\nthem conscious. For example, one person may feel that unless a schedule is\ndisplayed using a software-generated Gantt chart, that it is not a true or valid\nschedule. Another person may have a contrasting bias that detailed planning\nany further out than 30 days is a waste of time. Being open and transparent\nabout biases up front establishes a culture of openness and trust that can enable\nconsensus and collaboration.\nThe project manager is key in establishing and maintaining a safe, respectful,\nnonjudgmental environment that allows the project team to communicate openly.

This\ncan extend to being transparent about biases as well.\nIntegrity. Integrity is comprised of ethical behavior and honesty. Individuals\ndemonstrate honesty by surfacing risks, communicating their assumptions and\nbasis of estimates, delivering bad news early, ensuring status reports provide an\naccurate depiction of the project's status, and in many other ways. Ethical\nbehavior can include surfacing potential defects or negative effects in product\ndesign, disclosing potential conflicts of interest, ensuring fairness, and making\ndecisions based on environmental, stakeholder, and financial impacts.\nRespect. Demonstrating respect for each person, how the person thinks, the\nperson's skills, and the perspective and expertise the person brings to the project\nteam sets the stage for all project team members to adopt this behavior.\nPositive discourse. Throughout the project, diverse opinions, different ways of\napproaching situations, and misunderstandings will occur. These are a normal\npart of conducting projects. They present an opportunity to have a dialogue rather\nthan a debate. A dialogue entails working with others to resolve divergent\nopinions. The goal is to arrive at a resolution that all parties can embrace. A\ndebate, on the other hand, is a win-lose scenario where people are more\ninterested in winning personally than they are in being open to alternative\nsolutions to a problem.\nSupport. Projects can be challenging from the perspectives of technical\nchallenges, environmental influences, and interpersonal interactions. Supporting\nproject team members through problem solving and removing impediments builds\na supportive culture and leads to a trusting and collaborative environment.\nSupport can also be demonstrated by providing encouragement, showing\nempathy, and engaging in active listening.\nCourage. Recommending a new approach to a problem or a way of working can\nbe intimidating. Likewise, it can be challenging to disagree with a subject matter\nexpert or someone with greater authority. However, demonstrating the courage\nthat it takes to make a suggestion, disagree, or try something new enables a\nculture of experimentation and communicates to others that it is safe to be\ncourageous and try new approaches.\nCelebrating success. Focusing on project goals, challenges, and issues often\nsidelines the fact that individual project team members and the project team as a\nwhole are steadily progressing toward those goals.

There\nare a number of factors that contribute to high-performing project teams. The list below\nis not comprehensive, but it identifies some of the factors associated with high-\nperforming project teams.\nOpen communication. An environment that fosters open and safe communication\nallows for productive meetings, problem solving, brainstorming, and so forth. It\nis also the cornerstone for other factors, such as shared understanding, trust, and\ncollaboration.\nShared understanding. The purpose for the project and the benefits it will\nprovide are held in common.\nShared ownership. The more ownership of the outcomes that project team\nmembers feel, the better they are likely to perform.\nTrust. A project team in which its members trust each other is willing to go the\nextra distance to deliver success. People are less likely to do the extra work it\nmay take to succeed if they do not trust their project team members, project\nmanager, or the organization.\nCollaboration. Project teams that collaborate and work with each other rather\nthan work in silos or compete tend to generate more diverse ideas and end up\nwith better outcomes.\nAdaptability. Project teams that are able to adapt the way they work to the\nenvironment and the situation are more effective.\nResilience. When issues or failures occur, high-performing project teams recover\nquickly.\nEmpowerment. Project team members who feel empowered to make decisions\nabout the way they work perform better than those who are micromanaged.\nRecognition. Project teams who are recognized for the work they put in and the\nperformance they achieve are more likely to continue to perform well. Even the\nsimple act of showing appreciation reinforces positive team behavior.\n2.2.4 LEADERSHIP SKILLS"

Understanding that purpose is critical for people to\ncommit their time and energy in the right direction toward achieving the project\npurpose. The project vision summarizes the project's purpose clearly and succinctly. It\ndescribes a realistic, attractive view of the future project outcomes.\nIn addition to briefly describing the desired future state, the vision is a powerful\nmotivational tool. It is a way to create passion and meaning for a project's envisioned\ngoal. A common vision helps keep people pulling in the same direction. When\nimmersed in the details of everyday work, a clear understanding of the end goal can\nhelp guide local decisions toward the desired project outcome.\nA vision developed collaboratively between project team members and key\nstakeholders should answer these questions:\nWhat is the project purpose?\nWhat defines successful project work?\nHow will the future be better when the project outcomes are delivered?\nHow will the project team know that it is drifting from the vision?\nA good vision is clear, concise, and actionable. It does the following:\nSummarizes the project with a powerful phrase or short description,\nDescribes the best achievable outcome,\nCreates a common, cohesive picture in project team members’ minds, and\nInspires passion for the outcome.\n2.2.4.2 Critical Thinking\nThroughout the various project performance domains, there is a need to recognize\nbias, identify the root cause of problems, and consider challenging issues, such as\nambiguity, complexity, and so forth. Critical thinking helps to accomplish these\nactivities. Critical thinking includes disciplined, rational, logical, evidence-based\nthinking. It requires an open mind and the ability to analyze objectively. Critical\nthinking, especially when applied to discovery, can include conceptual imagination,"

A project team\nmember who is motivated by relatedness will respond to being part of a dynamic\nworking group. Project team members who thrive on autonomy will perform better if\nthey can establish their own ways of working and even their own work hours and\ncadence. Therefore, tailoring motivation methods based on individual preferences helps\nto elicit the best individual and project team performance.\n2.2.4.4 Interpersonal Skills\nInterpersonal skills that are used frequently in projects include emotional\nintelligence, decision making, and conflict resolution among others.\nEmotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize our\nown emotions and those of others. This information is used to guide thinking and\nbehavior. Recognition of personal feelings, empathy for the feelings of others,\nand the ability to act appropriately are the cornerstones for effective\ncommunication, collaboration, and leadership.\nSince projects are undertaken by people and for people, emotional intelligence—\nthe ability to understand one's self and effectively sustain working relationships\nwith others—is critical in project team environments.\nThere are multiple models for defining and explaining emotional intelligence.\nThey converge on four key areas:\nSelf-awareness. Self-awareness is the ability to conduct a realistic self-\nassessment. It includes understanding our own emotions, goals, motivations,\nstrengths, and weaknesses.\nSelf-management.

Project managers and project teams make many decisions\ndaily. Some decisions may be fairly inconsequential to the project outcome, such\nas where to go for a team lunch, and others will be very impactful, such as what\ndevelopment approach to use, which tool to use, or what vendor to select.\nDecisions can be made unilaterally. This has the advantage of being fast but is\nprone to error when compared to engaging the wisdom of a diverse set of people.\nUnilateral decision making can also demotivate people who are impacted by the\ndecision since they may feel their views and concerns were not considered.\nGroup-based decision making has the benefit of tapping into the broad knowledge\nbase of a group. Engaging people in the decision-making process also increases\nbuy-in to the outcome, even if the option selected may not have been everyone's\nfirst choice. Generally, inclusion increases commitment to the decision. The\ndownside of group decision making is the time required and interruption to\nteamwork that can occur when taking people away from their work to be\nconsulted in a decision.\nProject team decision making often follows a diverge/converge pattern. This\nmeans stakeholders are first engaged to generate a broad set of solution\nalternatives or approaches. This is often done individually to avoid the effect of\nsenior or charismatic stakeholders unduly influencing other stakeholders. Then,\nafter a broad spectrum of decision alternatives have been generated, the project\nteam converges on a preferred solution.\nThe goal is to make decisions quickly while engaging the diverse knowledge of a\ngroup in an inclusive and respectful manner. Some decisions may be made in a\ndifferent direction than some people prefer, but everyone has an opportunity to\nexplain their position. In the end, the deciding authority, whether an individual or\na group, makes a decision based on the presented analysis and with consideration\nfor stakeholder expectations.\nCareful selection of which decisions should go for group discussion and voting\nlimits the interruptions and task switching experienced by the project team.

They aim to engage individual input\nwhile voting at the same moment, which minimizes groupthink.\nFor those decisions that are beyond the authority of the project team to decide,\nthe project team can investigate alternatives, consider impacts of each\nalternative, and escalate the decision to someone with the proper authority.

Conflict happens on all projects. Projects operate in\ndynamic environments and face many mutually exclusive constraints including\nbudget, scope, schedule, and quality, which can lead to conflicts. It is not\nuncommon to want to avoid conflict, but not all conflict is negative. How conflict\nis handled can either lead to more conflict or to better decision making and\nstronger solutions.\nAddressing conflict before it escalates beyond useful debate leads to better\noutcomes. The following approaches can help:\nKeep communications open and respectful. Because conflict can cause\nanxiety, it is important to keep a safe environment to explore the source of the\nconflict. Without a safe environment, people will stop communicating. Make\nsure words, tone of voice, and body language remain nonthreatening.\nFocus on the issues, not the people. Conflict is based on people perceiving\nsituations differently. It should not be personal. The focus is on resolving the\nsituation, not casting blame.\nFocus on the present and future, not the past. Stay focused on the current\nsituation, not past situations. If something similar happened previously,\nbringing up the past will not resolve the current situation. In fact, it can serve\nto intensify the current situation even more.\nSearch for alternatives together. Damage incurred from conflict can be\nrepaired by looking for resolutions and alternatives together. It can also create\nmore constructive relationships. This moves the conflict into more of a\nproblem-solving space where people can work together to generate creative\nalternatives.\nThere are several models for addressing and resolving conflict. Some of them are\ndiscussed in Section 4.\n2.2.5 TAILORING LEADERSHIP STYLES\nAs with all aspects of projects, leadership styles are also tailored to meet the needs\nof the project, the environment, and the stakeholders. Some of the variables that\ninfluence tailoring of leadership styles include:"

Project team members who are mature\nin the technical field may need less oversight and direction than project team\nmembers who are new to the organization, the team, or the technical specialty.\nOrganizational governance structures. Projects operate within a larger\norganizational system. There may be the expectation that the organizational\nleadership style of top management is recognized and reflected in the team's\nleadership. The organizational structure influences the degree to which authority\nand accountability are centralized or distributed.\nDistributed project teams. A global project workforce is more common today\nthan in the past. In spite of the best efforts to connect people virtually, it can be\nchallenging to create the same level of collaboration and relatedness that is\nachieved when working face to face. To minimize the pitfalls of distributed\nproject teams, technology can be used to increase and improve communication.\nExamples include:\nEnsure there are collaboration sites for working together.\nHave a project team site to keep all relevant project and project team\ninformation available.\nUse audio and video capabilities for meetings.\nUse technology to maintain ongoing contact, such as messaging and texting.\nBuild in time to get to know remote project team members.\nHave at least one face-to-face meeting to establish relationships.\n2.2.6 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nThe Team Performance Domain emphasizes the skills used by project managers and\nproject team members throughout the project. These skills are woven into all other\naspects of the project. Project team members are called on to demonstrate leadership\nqualities and skills throughout the project. Communicating the project vision and\nbenefits to stakeholders while planning and throughout the life cycle is one example.\nAnother example is employing critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making\nwhile engaging in project work.

Projects that have a single delivery deliver at the end of the\nproject. For example, a process reengineering project may not have any\ndeliveries until near the end of the project when the new process is rolled out.\nMultiple deliveries.

Some projects have deliveries that are developed separately rather\nthan sequentially, such as a project to update building security. Deliveries may\ninclude physical barriers to entry, new badges, new key code pads, and so forth.\nEach of these is a separate delivery, but they do not need to come in a specific\norder. All of the deliveries are concluded before the project is considered to be\ncompleted.\nPeriodic deliveries. Periodic deliveries are like multiple deliveries, but they are\non a fixed delivery schedule, such as monthly or bimonthly. A new software\napplication may have internal deliveries every two weeks, and then periodically\nrelease the deliveries into the market.\nAnother delivery option is called continuous delivery. Continuous delivery is\nthe practice of delivering feature increments immediately to customers, often\nthrough the use of small batches of work and automation technology.\nContinuous delivery can be used for digital products. From the product\nmanagement perspective, the emphasis is on delivering benefits and value\nthroughout the product life cycle. Similar to a project, there are aspects that are\ndevelopment oriented. However, similar to a program, there can be many\ndevelopment cycles as well as maintenance activities. This type of undertaking\nworks better with project teams that are stable and remain intact. Because the\nproject teams are focused on one product, they can apply learning about the\nproduct, the stakeholders, and the market. This allows the team to respond to\nmarket trends and stay focused on value delivery. This practice is included in\nseveral approaches such as DevOps, #noprojects and Continuous Digital, for\nexample.\n2.3.3 DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES\nA development approach is the means used to create and evolve the product,\nservice, or result during the project life cycle. There are different development\napproaches, and different industries may use different terms to refer to development\napproaches. Three commonly used approaches are predictive, hybrid, and adaptive. As\nshown in Figure 2-7, these approaches are often viewed as a spectrum, from the\npredictive approach on one end of the spectrum, to the adaptive on the other end."

The scope, schedule, cost, resource\nneeds, and risks can be well defined in the early phases of the project life cycle,\nand they are relatively stable. This development approach allows the project\nteam to reduce the level of uncertainty early in the project and do much of the\nplanning up front.

An iterative approach may produce sufficient capability to be\nconsidered acceptable prior to the final iteration. An incremental approach is\nused to produce a deliverable throughout a series of iterations. Each iteration\nadds functionality within a predetermined time frame (a timebox). The\ndeliverable contains the capability to be considered as completed only after the\nfinal iteration.\nThe differences and interactions between iterative and incremental development\nare shown in Figure 2-8.\nAn example of a hybrid approach could be using an adaptive approach to\ndevelop a product that has significant uncertainty associated with the\nrequirements.

The following list outlines some of the\nvariables to consider when selecting the development approach.\nDegree of innovation. Deliverables where the scope and requirements are well\nunderstood, that the project team has worked with before, and that allow for\nplanning up front are well suited to a predictive approach. Deliverables that have\na high degree of innovation or where the project team does not have experience\nare better suited to a more adaptive approach.\nRequirements certainty. When the requirements are well known and easy to\ndefine, a predictive approach fits well. When requirements are uncertain,\nvolatile, or complex and are expected to evolve throughout the project, a more\nadaptive approach may be a better fit.\nScope stability. If the scope of the deliverable is stable and not likely to change,\na predictive approach is useful. If the scope is expected to have many changes, an\napproach that is closer to the adaptive side of the spectrum can be useful.\nEase of change. Related to the requirements certainty and the scope stability, if\nthe nature of the deliverable makes it difficult to manage and incorporate\nchanges, then a predictive approach is best. Deliverables that can adapt easily to\nchange can use an approach that is more adaptive.\nDelivery options. As described in Section 2.3.2 on Delivery Cadence, the nature\nof the deliverable and whether it can be delivered in components influences the\ndevelopment approach. Products, services, or results that can be developed\nand/or delivered in pieces are aligned with incremental, iterative, or adaptive\napproaches. Some large projects may be planned using a predictive approach,\nbut there may be some pieces that can be developed and delivered incrementally.\nRisk. Products that are inherently high risk require analysis before choosing the\ndevelopment approach. Some high-risk products may require significant up-front\nplanning and rigorous processes to reduce threats. Other products can reduce risk\nby building them modularly and adapting the design and development based on\nlearning to take advantage of emerging opportunities or reduce the exposure to\nthreats.\nSafety requirements.

If there is a need to deliver something early, even if it is\nnot a finished product, an iterative or adaptive approach is beneficial.\nFunding availability. Projects that work in an environment of funding uncertainty\ncan benefit from an adaptive or iterative approach.

Further investments\ncan be made based on the market response to the product or service.\n2.3.4.3 Organization\nOrganizational variables such as the structure, culture, capability, project team size,\nand location influence the development approach.\nOrganizational structure. An organizational structure that has many levels, a\nrigid reporting structure, and substantial bureaucracy frequently uses a predictive\napproach.

Adaptive approaches fit better within an organization that\nemphasizes project team self-management.\nOrganizational capability.

Project deliverables are put into use and transitional activities required\nfor sustainment, benefits realization, and organizational change management are\ncompleted.\nClose. The project is closed, project knowledge and artifacts are archived,\nproject team members are released, and contracts are closed.\nProject phases often have a phase gate review (also known as stage gate) to check\nthat the desired outcomes or exit criteria for the phase have been achieved before\nproceeding to the next phase. Exit criteria may tie to acceptance criteria for\ndeliverables, contractual obligations, meeting specific performance targets, or other\ntangible measures.\nFigure 2-9 shows a life cycle where one phase finishes before the next one begins.\nThis type of life cycle would fit well with a predictive development approach since\neach phase is only performed once, and each phase focuses on a particular type of\nwork. However, there are situations, such as adding scope, a change in requirements, or\na change in the market that cause phases to be repeated."

Prior to final closeout, the project charter and the\nbusiness case will be reviewed to determine if the deliverables achieved the\nintended benefits and value.\nFigure 2-12 shows a possible life cycle for the community center project. The start-\nup and planning phases are sequential. The development, test, and deploy phases\noverlap because the different deliverables will be developed, tested, and deployed at\ndifferent times, and some deliverables will have multiple deliveries. The development\nphase is shown in more detail to demonstrate different timing and delivery cadence. The\ntest phase cadence would follow the development phase cadence. The deliveries are\nshown in the deploy phase."

Some practitioners will say a project\nfollows an agile life cycle when they are actually talking about the\ndevelopment approach. Some practitioners refer to predictive approaches as\nwaterfall. Adaptive development approaches may also be known as\nevolutionary approaches.\nBecause project management is evolving, the language used continues to\nevolve. The best way to understand what a person is referring to is to\ndetermine how they are developing deliverables and ask them the names of the\nphases in the life cycle. This can help frame the project and understand how\npeople are using terms.\n2.3.7 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nThe Development Approach and Life Cycle Performance Domain interacts with the\nStakeholder, Planning, Uncertainty, Delivery, Project Work, and Team Performance\nDomains. The life cycle selected impacts the way in which planning is undertaken.\nPredictive life cycles undertake the bulk of the planning up front and then continue to\nreplan by using rolling wave planning and progressive elaboration. Plans are also\nupdated as threats and opportunities materialize.\nThe development approach and delivery cadence is one way to reduce uncertainty\non projects. A deliverable that has a lot of risk associated with meeting regulatory\nrequirements may choose a predictive approach to build in extra testing, documentation,\nand robust processes and procedures. A deliverable that has a lot of risk associated\nwith stakeholder acceptance may choose an iterative approach and release a minimum\nviable product to the market to get feedback before developing additional features and\nfunctions.\nThe Development Approach and Life Cycle Performance Domain has significant\noverlap with the Delivery Performance Domain when considering delivery cadence and\ndevelopment approach. The delivery cadence is one of the main drivers of delivering\nvalue in alignment with the business case and the benefits realization plans. Eliciting the\nproduct requirements and meeting the quality requirements as described in the Delivery\nPerformance Domain have a significant influence on the development approach."

      "content": "2.4.1 PLANNING OVERVIEW\nThe purpose of planning is to proactively develop an approach to create the project\ndeliverables. The project deliverables drive the outcomes the project was undertaken to\nachieve. High-level planning may begin prior to project authorization. The project team\nprogressively elaborates initial project documents, such as a vision statement, project\ncharter, business case, or similar documents to identify or define a coordinated path to\nachieve the desired outcomes.\nIt is becoming more common for initial planning to consider social and\nenvironmental impacts in addition to the financial impacts (sometimes referred\nto as the triple bottom line). This may take the form of a product life cycle\nassessment which evaluates the potential environmental impacts of a product,\nprocess, or system. The product life cycle assessment informs the design of\nproducts and processes. It considers the impacts of materials and processes\nwith regards to sustainability, toxicity, and the environment.\nThe amount of time spent planning, both up front and throughout the project, should\nbe determined by the circumstances. It is inefficient to spend more time planning than is\nneeded. Therefore, the information gained from planning should be sufficient to move\nforward in an appropriate manner but not more detailed than necessary. Project teams\nuse planning artifacts to confirm stakeholder expectations and provide stakeholders\nwith the information they need to make decisions, take action, and maintain alignment\nbetween the project and stakeholders.\n2.4.2 PLANNING VARIABLES\nBecause each project is unique, the amount, timing, and frequency of planning\nvaries. Variables that influence how project planning is conducted include, but are not\nlimited to:\nDevelopment approach. The development approach can influence how, how\nmuch, and when planning is conducted. Examples include:\nA specific phase for planning or organizing early in the life cycle. In these\nsituations, much of the planning is performed up front. The initial plans are\nprogressively elaborated with more detail throughout the project, but there is\nlittle change to the original scope."

Some\nplanning occurs up front to establish release plans and further planning occurs\nat the beginning of each iteration.\nProject deliverables. Often the project deliverables necessitate planning in a\nspecific way. Construction projects require significant up-front planning to\naccount for design, approvals, materials purchasing, logistics, and delivery.\nProduct development or high-technology projects may use continuous and\nadaptive planning to allow for evolution and changes based on stakeholder\nfeedback and technological advances.\nOrganizational requirements. Organizational governance, policies, procedures,\nprocesses, and culture may require project managers to produce specific planning\nartifacts.\nMarket conditions.

Regulatory agencies or statutes may require\nspecific planning documents before granting an authorization to proceed or to\nsecure approval to release the project deliverable into the market.\n2.4.2.1 Delivery\nPlanning begins with understanding the business case, stakeholder requirements, and\nthe project and product scope. Product scope is the features and functions that\ncharacterize a product, service, or result. Project scope is the work performed to\ndeliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions.\nPredictive planning approaches start with the high-level project deliverables up\nfront and decompose them into more detail. This approach can employ a scope\nstatement and/or a work breakdown structure (WBS) to decompose the scope into\nlower levels of detail.\nProjects that use iterative or incremental approaches can have high-level themes or\nepics that are decomposed into features, which are then further decomposed into user\nstories and other backlog items. Work that is unique, significant, risky, or novel can be\nprioritized to reduce the uncertainty associated with project scope at the start of the\nproject before significant investment has taken place.

Estimates are a quantitative assessment of the likely amount or\noutcome of a variable, such as project costs, resources, effort, or duration. As the\nproject evolves, the estimates can change based on current information and\ncircumstances. The project's phase in the life cycle impacts four aspects associated with\nestimating:\nRange. Estimates tend to have a broad range at the start of the project when there\nis not much information about the project and product scope, stakeholders,\nrequirements, risks, and other information. Figure 2-14 shows a range of -25 to\n+75% at the start of exploring a project opportunity. Projects that are well along\nin their life cycle may have an estimating range of -5 to +10%.\nAccuracy. Accuracy refers to the correctness of an estimate. Accuracy is linked\nto range in that the lower the accuracy, the larger the potential range of values. An\nestimate at the start of the project will have less accuracy than one that is\ndeveloped halfway through the project.\nPrecision. Precision is different from accuracy (see Figure 2-15). Precision\nrefers to the degree of exactness associated with the estimate. For example, an\nestimate of 2 days is more precise than “sometime this week.” The precision of\nestimates should be compatible with the desired accuracy.\nConfidence. Confidence increases with experience. Experience working on a\nprevious, similar project can help with the level of confidence required. For new\nand evolving technology components, the confidence in estimates is expected to\nbe low."

They can be developed manually by (a)\ndeveloping a weighted average based on multiple likely outcomes, or (b) running\na simulation to develop a probability analysis of a particular outcome, usually in\nterms of cost or schedule.\nA probabilistic estimate derived from a computer simulation has three\nassociated factors:\n1. A point estimate with a range such as 36 months +3 months/-1 month.\n2. A statement of confidence such as a 95% confidence level.\n3. A probability distribution describing the dispersion of the data within and\naround the given range.\nTogether these three items form a complete metric describing a probabilistic\nestimate.\nAbsolute and relative estimating.

Throughput is the number of items that can complete a\nprocess in a given amount of time. These two numbers can provide an estimate to\ncomplete a specified quantity of work.\nAdjusting estimates for uncertainty. Estimates are inherently uncertain.\nUncertainty by definition is associated with risk. Key deliverable dates or budget\nestimates may be adjusted, or contingency time or funds may be added, based on\nthe outcomes of a simulation conducted to establish the range of uncertainty for\nthese parameters.\n2.4.2.3 Schedules\nA schedule is a model for executing the project's activities, including durations,\ndependencies, and other planning information. Schedule planning can use predictive or\nadaptive approaches.\nPredictive approaches follow a stepwise process as follows:\nStep 1. Decompose the project scope into specific activities.\nStep 2. Sequence related activities.\nStep 3. Estimate the effort, duration, people, and physical resources required to\ncomplete the activities.\nStep 4. Allocate people and resources to the activities based on availability.\nStep 5. Adjust the sequence, estimates, and resources until an agreed-upon\nschedule is achieved.\nIf the schedule model does not meet the initial desired end date, schedule\ncompression methods are applied. Crashing is a schedule compression method that\nseeks to shorten the duration for the least incremental cost. Crashing can include adding\npeople to activities, working overtime, or paying to expedite deliveries.\nFast tracking is a schedule compression method in which activities or tasks that are\nnormally done in sequence are performed in parallel, at least for a portion of their\nduration. Fast tracking often entails applying leads and lags along a network path. A\nlead is where the work of a successor activity is accelerated, such as starting a"

Each iteration\nadds business and/or stakeholder value. Value may include features, risk reduction,\nexperimentation, or other ways of delivering or protecting value.

The\ninformation in Section 2.4.2.2 on Estimating is applied to project costs to develop cost\nestimates. Cost estimates are then aggregated to develop the cost baseline. The cost\nbaseline is often allocated across the project schedule to reflect when the costs will be\nincurred. This practice allows project managers to balance the funds approved in a\nspecific budget period with the scheduled work. If there are funding limitations for a\nbudget period, the work may need to be rescheduled to meet those limitations.\nThe project budget should include contingency reserve funds to allow for\nuncertainty.

Small project teams that can\nwork in the same room are able to take advantage of osmotic communication and can\nsolve problems as they arise. Some project teams are physically dispersed.

Planning\nfor physical resources entails estimating, as described in Section 2.4.2.2, as well as\nsupply chain, logistics, and management. Projects with significant physical resources,\nsuch as engineering and construction projects, will need to plan for procurement\nactivities to acquire the resources.

This can take the form of\nreviewing task boards to determine if there are bottlenecks in the process, if work is\nflowing at the expected rate, and if there are any impediments that are blocking\nprogress.\nProcess tailoring can be used to optimize the process for the needs of the project. In\ngeneral, large projects have more process compared to small projects, and critical\nprojects have more process than less significant projects. Tailoring takes into\nconsideration the demands of the environment. Ways of optimizing the processes for the\nenvironment include:\nLean production methods. Lean production uses techniques such as value\nstream mapping to measure the ratio of value-adding activities and non-value-\nadding activities. The metrics calculated form a basis and measurement system\nfor identifying and removing waste from production systems.\nRetrospectives or lessons learned. These meetings provide an opportunity for\nthe project team to review the way in which it works and to suggest changes to\nimprove process and efficiency.\nWhere is the next best funding spent? Asking this question can help project\nteams determine if they should continue with the current task or move onto the\nnext activity to optimize value delivery.\nReviewing processes can entail determining if processes are efficient, or if there is\nwaste in the process that can be eliminated. Time spent tracking conformance to process\nis time the project team cannot spend on delivering the outcomes for which the project\nwas commissioned. Therefore, project teams utilize just enough time reviewing process\nconformance to maximize the benefits delivered from the review while still satisfying\nthe governance needs of process.\nExample of non-value-added work. A PMO wants to track the type of work\nproject team members are doing. They ask the project team to record the type\nof work they are doing in specific categories on their time sheets.

Process evaluation can include process\naudits and quality assurance activities to ensure processes are being followed and are\naccomplishing the intended outcomes.\n2.5.2 BALANCING COMPETING CONSTRAINTS\nSuccessfully leading a project includes understanding the constraints associated\nwith the work. Constraints can take the form of fixed delivery dates, compliance to\nregulatory codes, a predetermined budget, quality policies, considerations of the triple\nbottom line, and so forth. The constraints may shift and change throughout the project. A\nnew stakeholder requirement may entail expanding the schedule and budget. A reduction\nin budget may entail relaxing a quality requirement or reducing scope.\nBalancing these shifting constraints, while maintaining stakeholder satisfaction, is\nan ongoing project activity. At times, it may include meeting with the customer, sponsor,\nor product owner to present alternatives and implications. Other times, the decisions\nand potential variances may be within the project team's authority to make trade-offs to\ndeliver the end result. Either way, this balancing activity is ongoing throughout the\nproject.\n2.5.3 MAINTAINING PROJECT TEAM FOCUS\nProject managers have a responsibility for assessing and balancing the project team\nfocus and attention. This involves evaluating short- and long-term projections of\nprogress toward delivery goals.\nLeading the project team includes balancing the workload and assessing if project\nteam members are satisfied with their work so they remain motivated. To maximize\nbusiness and stakeholder value delivered throughout the project, project team attention\nneeds to be kept in a healthy balance. Leading with a goal of maximizing overall\ndelivered value involves focusing on production (delivering value) and protecting the\nproject team's production capability (project team health and satisfaction). The goal is\nto keep the project team focused on delivering value and maintain awareness of when\npotential issues, delays, and cost overruns enter the project.\n2.5.4 PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT\nMuch of the project work is associated with communication and engagement,\nespecially work associated with maintaining project team member and other\nstakeholder engagement.

An abundance of ad hoc communication\nrequests may indicate that the communication planning was not sufficient to meet\nstakeholder needs. In this situation, further stakeholder engagement may be necessary to\nensure stakeholder information requirements are met.\n2.5.5 MANAGING PHYSICAL RESOURCES\nSome projects require materials and supplies from third parties. Planning, ordering,\ntransporting, storing, tracking, and controlling these physical resources can take a large\namount of time and effort.\nLarge amounts of physical resources require an integrated logistics system. This is\nusually documented in company policies that are then implemented in projects. A\nlogistics plan describes how the company policy will be implemented on the project.\nSupporting documentation includes estimates for the type of material, basis of estimates,\nexpected usage over time, specifications for grade, and the time and location for\ndeliveries.\nThe objectives from a physical resource perspective are to:\nReduce or eliminate the material handling and storage on site,\nEliminate wait times for materials,\nMinimize scrap and waste, and\nFacilitate a safe work environment.\nAll of this work is integrated with the master project schedule to provide clear\nexpectations and communications for all parties involved.\n2.5.6 WORKING WITH PROCUREMENTS\nMany projects involve some form of contracting or procurement. Procurement can\ncover everything from material, capital equipment, and supplies to solutions, labor, and\nservices. In most organizations, project managers do not have contracting authority.\nRather, they work with contracting officers or other people with expertise in contracts,\nlaws, and regulations. Organizations usually have rigorous policies and procedures"

The policies identify who has authority to enter into a\ncontract, the limits of authority, and the processes and procedures that should be\nfollowed.\nPrior to conducting a procurement, the project manager and technically qualified\nproject team members work with contracting professionals to develop the request for\nproposals (RFP), statement of work (SOW), terms and conditions, and other necessary\ndocuments to go out to bid.\n2.5.6.1 The Bid Process\nThe bid process includes developing and publicizing bid documents, bidder\nconferences, and selecting a bidder.\nBid documents can include:\nRequest for information. A request for information is used to gather more\ninformation from the market prior to sending out bid documents to a set of\nselected vendors.\nRequest for proposal. This bid document is used for complex or complicated\nscope where the buyer is looking for the vendor to provide a solution.\nRequest for quote. This bid document is used when price is the main deciding\nfactor, and the proposed solution is readily available.\nThese three types cover the majority of bidding needs. There are other bid\ndocuments; however, they tend to be industry specific.\nOnce the bid documents are distributed, the buyer generally has a bidder conference\nto respond to bidder questions and provide clarifying information. Then the bidders\ndevelop their responses and deliver them to the buyer by the date specified in the bid\ndocuments.\nChoosing the best vendor, sometimes known as source selection, is often based on a\nnumber of criteria, such as experience, references, price, and timely delivery. These\nvariables may be weighted to reflect the relative importance of each. The buyer\nevaluates vendor bids against the criteria to select an appropriate vendor(s). The buyer\nand vendor negotiate terms and conditions. Most everything can be negotiated, from cost\nto delivery and payment dates, to location of work, ownership of intellectual property,\nand so forth.\n2.5.6.2 Contracting"

      "content": "Eventually, the parties reach agreement and enter into a contract. The type of\ncontracting vehicle depends on the size of the purchase, the stability of the scope of\nwork, and the risk tolerances of the organizations.\nFor projects that use an adaptive approach for some deliverables and a\npredictive approach for others, a master agreement may be used for the overall\ncontract. The adaptive work may be placed in an appendix or supplement. This\nallows the changes to occur on the adaptive scope without impacting the\noverall contract.\nOnce the vendor is selected, the project plans and documents are updated to\nincorporate vendor dates, resources, costs, quality requirements, risks, etc. From that\npoint, the vendor becomes a project stakeholder. Information in the Stakeholders\nPerformance Domain and Measurement Performance Domain will apply to the\nvendor(s) throughout the project.\nProcurements can take place at any point during the project. All procurement\nactivities are integrated into the project operations.\n2.5.7 MONITORING NEW WORK AND CHANGES\nIn adaptive projects, there is an expectation that work will evolve and adapt. As a\nresult, new work can be added to the product backlog, as needed. However, if more\nwork is added than is being completed, or if the same amount of work is added that is\nbeing completed, the project will continue without end. The project manager works\nwith the product owner to manage expectations around adding scope, the implications to\nthe budget, and the availability of project team members. The product owner prioritizes\nthe project backlog on an ongoing basis so that high-priority items are completed. If the\nschedule or budget is constrained, the product owner may consider the project done\nwhen the highest priority items are delivered.\nIn predictive projects, the project team actively manages changes to the work to\nensure only approved changes are included in the scope baseline. Any changes to the\nscope are then accompanied by appropriate changes to the people, resources, schedule,\nand budget. Scope changes can add to uncertainty; therefore, any change requests should\nbe accompanied by an evaluation of any new risks that are introduced due to the\naddition to or change in scope. The project manager works with the change control\nboard and the change requestor to guide change requests through the change control"

Ways of working can evolve to produce better\noutcomes.\n2.5.8.1 Knowledge Management\nA lot of learning takes place during projects. Some of the learning is project\nspecific, such as a faster way to accomplish specific work. Some learning can be\nshared with other project teams to improve outcomes, such as a quality assurance\napproach that results in fewer defects. Still other learning can be shared throughout the\norganization, such as training users how to work with a new software application.\n2.5.8.2 Explicit and Tacit Knowledge\nThroughout the project, project teams develop and share explicit knowledge.\nExplicit knowledge can be readily codified using words, pictures, or numbers. For\nexample, the steps to a new process are explicit knowledge that can be documented.\nExplicit knowledge can be distributed using information management tools to connect\npeople to information, such as manuals, registers, web searches, and databases.\nAnother type of knowledge is tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is challenging to\nexpress as it cannot be codified. Tacit knowledge is comprised of experience, insights,\nand practical knowledge or skill. Tacit knowledge is shared by connecting the people\nwho need the knowledge with people who have the knowledge. This can be\naccomplished via networking, interviews, job shadowing, discussion forums,\nworkshops, or other similar methods.\nBecause projects are temporary endeavors, much of the knowledge is lost once the\nproject is completed. Being attentive to knowledge transfer serves the organization by\nnot only delivering the value that the project was undertaken to achieve, it also allows\nthe organization to gain knowledge from the experience of running projects.\n2.5.9 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS"

Projects that deliver the bulk of their deliverable\nat the end of the project life cycle generate value after the initial deployment.\nBusiness value often continues to be captured long after the initial project has\nended.

Requirements can be very high\nlevel, such as those found in a business case, or they can be very detailed, such as those\nfound in acceptance criteria for a component of a system.\nProjects that have a well-defined scope, which is relatively stable, generally work\nwith project stakeholders to elicit and document the requirements during up-front\nplanning. Projects that have a high-level understanding of the requirements at the start of\na project may evolve those requirements over time. Some projects discover\nrequirements during project work.\nRequirements elicitation. To elicit means to draw out, bring forth, or evoke.\nThere is more to collecting requirements than interviewing or conducting focus\ngroups. Sometimes requirements are drawn out by analyzing data, observing\nprocesses, reviewing defect logs, or other methods.\nPart of eliciting requirements is documenting them and gaining stakeholder\nagreement. Well-documented requirements meet the following criteria:\nClear. There is only one way to interpret the requirement.\nConcise. The requirement is stated in as few words as possible.\nVerifiable. There is a way to verify that the requirement has been met.\nConsistent. There are no contradictory requirements.\nComplete. The set of requirements represents the entirety of the current project\nor product needs.\nTraceable.

Evolving requirements are common in projects using\niterative, incremental, or adaptive development approaches. In some cases, new\nopportunities arise that change requirements.\nManaging requirements. Regardless of whether requirements are documented\nup front, evolved along the way, or discovered, there is a need to manage them.\nIneffective requirements management can lead to rework, scope creep, customer\ndissatisfaction, budget overruns, schedule delay, and overall project failure."

Scope is\nthe sum of the products, services, and results to be provided as a project. As scope is\ndefined, it creates the need for more requirements identification. Therefore, like\nrequirements, scope can be well defined up front, it can evolve over time, or it can be\ndiscovered.\nScope decomposition. Scope can be elaborated using a scope statement to\nidentify the major deliverables associated with the project and the acceptance\ncriteria for each deliverable. Scope can also be elaborated by decomposing it\ninto lower levels of detail using a work breakdown structure (WBS). A WBS is a\nhierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the\nproject team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required\ndeliverables. Each level down in the hierarchy represents a greater level of\ndetail of the deliverable and work required to produce it.\nAnother way to elaborate scope is by identifying the themes of the project in an\nagile charter, roadmap, or as part of the product hierarchy. Themes represent\nlarge groups of customer value reflected as user stories associated by a common\nfactor, such as functionality, data source, or security level. To accomplish themes,\nthe project team develops epics, which are logical containers for a large user\nstory that is too big to complete within an iteration. Epics may be decomposed\ninto features, a set of related requirements typically described as a short phrase\nor function, which represent specific behaviors of a product. Each feature will\nhave multiple user stories. A user story is a brief description of an outcome for a\nspecific user, which is a promise for a conversation to clarify details. The\nproject team defines story details at the last responsible moment to avoid\nwasteful planning should the scope change. The story is a clear and concise\nrepresentation of a requirement written from the end user's perspective.\nCompletion of deliverables.

This extension, known as a WBS\ndictionary, elaborates the information for each deliverable (work package) in\nthe WBS.\nDefinition of done. The definition of done is used with adaptive approaches,\nparticularly in software development projects. It is a checklist of all the\ncriteria required to be met so that a deliverable can be considered ready for\ncustomer use.\n2.6.2.3 Moving Targets of Completion\nProjects that operate in uncertain and rapidly changing environments face the\nsituation that a “good enough for release” or “done” goal may be subject to change. In\nmarkets where competitors are releasing new products frequently, the features planned\nfor a new release may be updated. Likewise, new technology trends, such as mobile\ndevices or wearable devices, might trigger a change in direction or introduce new\nrequirements.\nIn these environments, the definition of the project goal being delivered or “done” is\nconstantly moving. Project teams track the planned rate of project goal achievement\nrelative to the rate of progress toward completion. The longer the project takes to\ncomplete, the further the project goal of “done” is likely to move. This is sometimes\nreferred to as “done drift.”\nFigure 2-21 shows a scenario for developing a new smart watch. The initial\nschedule shows 12 months to develop the watch with the initial set of\ncapabilities and features. As competitors launch similar products, the initial set\nof capabilities and features increases to stay relevant with the market. This\npushes the launch date to Month 14. At 13 months, another competitor launches\na product with even more capabilities. Adding these capabilities would delay\nthe launch to Month 16. At some point, a decision will be made whether to\nrelease the product as is, even though it doesn't have the latest features, or\ncontinue to update the features prior to launch."

This\nmodel identifies four categories of costs associated with quality: prevention, appraisal,\ninternal failure, and external failure. Prevention and appraisal costs are associated with\nthe cost of compliance to quality requirements. Internal and external failure costs are\nassociated with the cost of noncompliance.\nPrevention. Prevention costs are incurred to keep defects and failures out of a\nproduct. Prevention costs avoid quality problems. They are associated with the\ndesign, implementation, and maintenance of the quality management system. They\nare planned and incurred before actual operation. Examples include:\nProduct or service requirements, such as the establishment of specifications\nfor incoming materials, processes, finished products, and services;\nQuality planning, such as the creation of plans for quality, reliability,\noperations, production, and inspection;\nQuality assurance, such as the creation and maintenance of the quality system;\nand\nTraining, such as the development, preparation, and maintenance of programs.\nAppraisal. Appraisal costs are incurred to determine the degree of conformance\nto quality requirements. Appraisal costs are associated with measuring and\nmonitoring activities related to quality. These costs may be associated with\nevaluation of purchased materials, processes, products, and services to ensure\nthat they conform to specifications. They could include:\nVerification, such as checking incoming material, process setup, and products\nagainst agreed specifications;\nQuality audits, such as confirmation that the quality system is functioning\ncorrectly; and\nSupplier rating, such as assessment and approval of suppliers of products and\nservices.\nInternal Failure.

External failure costs are associated with defects found after\nthe customer has the product and with remediation. Note that to consider these\nfailures holistically requires thinking about the project's product while it is in\noperation after months or years, not just at the handover date. External failure\ncosts occur when products or services that fail to reach design quality standards\nare not detected until after they have reached the customer. Examples include:\nRepairs and servicing, for both returned products and those that are deployed;\nWarranty claims, such as failed products that are replaced or services that are\nreperformed under a guarantee;\nComplaints, for all work and costs associated with handling and servicing\ncustomers’ complaints;\nReturns, for handling and investigation of rejected or recalled products,\nincluding transport costs; and\nReputation, where reputation and public perception can be damaged\ndepending on the type and severity of defects.\nTo optimize delivered value, early inspection and review work focused on finding\nquality issues as soon as possible are good investments.

This approach can include quality analysts working with\ndesigners and engineers to understand and determine how best to achieve quality during\neach step in the project life cycle. Being proactive about quality work helps avoid the\nhigh cost of change associated with fixing quality issues discovered later in the life\ncycle.

There are two types of KPIs: leading indicators and\nlagging indicators.\nLeading indicators. Leading indicators predict changes or trends in the project.\nIf the change or trend is unfavorable, the project team evaluates the root cause of\nthe leading indicator measurement and takes actions to reverse the trend. Used in\nthis way, leading indicators can reduce performance risk on a project by\nidentifying potential performance variances before they cross the tolerance\nthreshold.\nLeading indicators may be quantifiable, such as the size of the project or the\nnumber of items that are in progress in the backlog. Other leading indicators are\nmore difficult to quantify, but they provide early warning signs of potential\nproblems. The lack of a risk management process, stakeholders who are not\navailable or engaged, or poorly defined project success criteria are all examples\nof leading indicators that project performance may be at risk.\nLagging indicators. Lagging indicators measure project deliverables or events.\nThey provide information after the fact. Lagging indicators reflect past\nperformance or conditions. Lagging indicators are easier to measure than leading\nindicators. Examples include the number of deliverables completed, the schedule\nor cost variance, and the amount of resources consumed.\nLagging indicators can also be used to find correlations between outcomes and\nenvironmental variables. For example, a lagging indicator that shows a schedule\nvariance may show a correlation with project team member dissatisfaction. This\ncorrelation can assist the project team in addressing a root cause that may not\nhave been obvious if the only measure was schedule status.\nIn and of themselves, KPIs are simply measures that have no real use unless and\nuntil they are used.

Customary measures include:\nInformation on errors or defects. This measure includes the source of defects,\nnumber of defects identified, and number of defects resolved.\nMeasures of performance. Measures of performance characterize physical or\nfunctional attributes relating to the system operation.

It is used to help the project team limit the\nnumber of items in progress to a manageable size.\nLead time. This measure indicates the amount of elapsed time from a story or\nchunk of work entering the backlog to the end of the iteration or the release.\nLower lead time indicates a more effective process and a more productive\nproject team.\nCycle time.

Little's Law states that queue size is\nproportional to both the rate of arrival in the queue and the rate of completion of\nitems from the queue. One can gain insights into completion times by measuring\nwork in progress and developing a forecast for future work completion.\nBatch size. Batch size measures the estimated amount of work (level of effort,\nstory points, etc.) that is expected to be completed in an iteration.\nProcess efficiency. Process efficiency is a ratio used in lean systems to optimize\nthe flow of work. This measure calculates the ratio between value-adding time\nand non-value-adding activities. Tasks that are waiting increase the non-value-\nadding time. Tasks that are in development or in verification represent value-\nadding time. Higher ratios indicate a more efficient process.\n2.7.2.3 Baseline Performance\nThe most common baselines are cost and schedule. Projects that track a scope or\ntechnical baseline can use information in the deliverable measures.\nMost schedule measures track actual performance to planned performance related\nto:\nStart and finish dates. Comparing the actual start dates to the planned start dates\nand the actual finish dates to the planned finish dates can measure the extent to\nwhich work is accomplished as planned.

Business value has many\naspects—both financial and nonfinancial. Metrics that measure financial business value\ninclude:\nCost-benefit ratio. This is a measure of the expected present value of an\ninvestment with the initial cost. The cost-benefit ratio is used to determine if the\ncosts of a project outweigh its benefits. If the costs are greater than the benefits,\nthe result will be greater than 1.0. In this case, the project should not be\nconsidered unless there are regulatory, social good, or other reasons to do the\nproject. A similar measure is a benefit-cost ratio. The same measures are used,\nbut the benefits are in the numerator and the costs are in the denominator. For this\nmeasure, if the ratio is greater than 1.0, the project should be considered.\nPlanned benefits delivery compared to actual benefits delivery. As part of a\nbusiness case, organizations may identify value as the benefit that will be\ndelivered as a result of doing the project. For projects that expect to deliver\nbenefits during the project life cycle, measuring the benefits delivered and the\nvalue of those benefits, then comparing that information to the business case,\nprovides information that can justify the continuation of the project, or in some\ncases, the cancellation of the project.\nReturn on investment (ROI). A measure of the amount of financial return\ncompared to the cost, ROI is generally developed as an input to the decision to\nundertake a project. There may be estimates of ROI at different points in time\nacross the project life cycle. By measuring ROI throughout the project, the\nproject team can determine if it makes sense to continue the investment of\norganizational resources.\nNet present value (NPV).

A Net Promoter Score measures the degree to\nwhich a stakeholder (usually the customer) is willing to recommend a product or\nservice to others. It measures a range from -100 to +100. A high Net Promoter\nScore not only measures satisfaction with a brand, product, or service, it is also\nan indicator of customer loyalty.\nMood chart.

Forecasts\ncan be qualitative, such as using expert judgment about what the future will hold. They\ncan also be causal when seeking to understand the impact a specific event or condition\nwill have on future events. Quantitative forecasts seek to use past information to\nestimate what will happen in the future.

There are\nmany different ways to calculate the estimate to complete. Assuming past\nperformance is indicative of future performance, a common measurement is\ncalculation of the budget at completion minus the earned value, then dividing by\nthe cost performance index. For more calculations to determine the ETC, see The\nStandard for Earned Value Management [2].\nEstimate at completion (EAC). This earned value management measure\nforecasts the expected total cost of completing all work (see Figure 2-26). There\nare many different ways to calculate the estimate at completion.

For this reason, the effects of any activity\ncannot be predicted precisely, and a range of outcomes can occur.

It is also important to recognize when further information\ncollection and analysis exceed the benefit of having the additional information.\nPrepare for multiple outcomes. In situations where there are only a few\npossible outcomes from an area of uncertainty, the project team can prepare for\neach of those outcomes. This entails having a primary solution available, as well\nas having backup or contingency plans in case the initial solution is not viable or\neffective. Where there is a large set of potential outcomes, the project team can\ncategorize and assess the potential causes to estimate their likelihood of\noccurrence. This allows the project team to identify the most likely potential\noutcomes on which to focus.\nSet-based design. Multiple designs or alternatives can be investigated early in\nthe project to reduce uncertainty. This allows the project team to look at trade-\noffs, such as time versus cost, quality versus cost, risk versus schedule, or\nschedule versus quality. The intention is to explore options so the project team\ncan learn from working with the various alternatives. Ineffective or suboptimal\nalternatives are discarded throughout the process.\nBuild in resilience. Resilience is the ability to adapt and respond quickly to\nunexpected changes. Resilience applies to both project team members and\norganizational processes. If the initial approach to product design or a prototype\nis not effective, the project team and the organization need to be able to learn,\nadapt, and respond quickly.\n2.8.2 AMBIGUITY\nThere are two categories of ambiguity: conceptual ambiguity and situational\nambiguity. Conceptual ambiguity—the lack of effective understanding—occurs when\npeople use similar terms or arguments in different ways. For example, the statement,\n“The schedule was reported on track last week,” is not clear. It isn't clear whether the\nschedule was on track last week or whether it was reported on last week. In addition,\nthere could be some question as to what “on track” means. Ambiguity of this type can be\nreduced by formally establishing common rules and definitions of terms, such as what\ndoes “on track” mean.\nSituational ambiguity surfaces when more than one outcome is possible. Having\nmultiple options to solve a problem is a form of situational ambiguity. Solutions for\nexploration of ambiguity include progressive elaboration, experimentation, and the use\nof prototypes."

The effect of complexity is that\nthere is no way of making accurate predictions about the likelihood of any potential\noutcome or even of knowing what outcomes might emerge.

      "content": "2.8.5 RISK\nRisks are an aspect of uncertainty. A risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it\noccurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives. Negative\nrisks are called threats, and positive risks are called opportunities. All projects have\nrisks since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of uncertainty.\nProject team members should proactively identify risks throughout the project to\navoid or minimize the impacts of threats and trigger or maximize the impacts of\nopportunities. Both threats and opportunities have a set of possible response strategies\nthat can be planned for implementation should the risk occur.\nIn order to navigate risk effectively, the project team needs to know what level of\nrisk exposure is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is defined by\nmeasurable risk thresholds that reflect the risk appetite and attitude of the organization\nand project stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the acceptable variation around an\nobjective that reflects the risk appetite of the organization and stakeholders. Thresholds\nare typically stated and communicated to the project team and reflected in the\ndefinitions of risk impact levels for the project.\nOverall Project Risk\nOverall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole,\narising from all sources of uncertainty. This includes individual risks and the\nexposure to the implications of variation in project outcome, both positive and\nnegative. Overall risk is often a function of complexity, ambiguity, and\nvolatility. Responses to overall project risk are the same as for individual\nthreats and opportunities, though responses are applied to the overall project\nrather than to a specific event. If the overall risk on the project is too high, the\norganization may choose to cancel the project.\n2.8.5.1 Threats\nA threat is an event or condition that, if it occurs, has a negative impact on one or\nmore objectives. Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with threats,\nas follows:\nAvoid. Threat avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or\nprotect the project from its impact."

The\ntailoring process is driven by the guiding project management principles in The\nStandard for Project Management [1], organizational values, and organizational\nculture. For instance, if a core organizational value is “customer centricity,” then the\nactivities selected for requirements elicitation and scope validation favor customer-\ncentered approaches. This aligns with the principle of “Effectively engage with\nstakeholders.” Likewise, an organization with a low appetite for risk may have many\nprocesses and procedures to guide projects throughout their life cycles. A similar\ncompany operating in the same market—but with a high tolerance for risk—may have\nfewer processes and procedures. In both of these examples, the organizations are\naligned with the principle of “Optimize risk responses” even though their appetite,\nprocesses, and procedures are different.\nTailoring entails the mindful selection and adjustment of multiple project factors,\nregardless of whether the label of “tailoring” is used.\nThe alternative to tailoring is using an unmodified framework or methodology.\nThere are many methodologies available that provide descriptions of\nprocesses, phases, methods, artifacts, and templates to be used in projects.\nThese methodologies and their components are not customized to the\norganizational context.\nMost of these methodologies have clear instructions stating they should not be\napplied rigorously but should be subject to a process of tailoring to determine\nwhich elements are most useful given the particular type, size, and complexity"

Many variables factor into the tailoring process, including the criticality\nof the project and the number of stakeholders involved. Using these variables as an\nexample, it is evident that the rigor, checks and balances, and reporting required for a\ncritical project (e.g., building a nuclear reactor) are much greater than those for building\na new office building.\nLikewise, the communication and coordination of work necessary for a project team\nof 10 people is insufficient for a project team of 200 people.

Many organizations have a project methodology,\ngeneral management approach, or general development approach that is used as a\nstarting point for their projects. These guides are intended to support such things as\nrepeatable processes, consistent measures of the organization's project capabilities, and\ncontinuous improvement of those capabilities. Organizations that have established\nprocess governance need to ensure tailoring is aligned to policy. To demonstrate that the\nproject team's tailoring decisions do not threaten the organization's larger strategic or\nstewardship goals, project teams may need to justify using a tailored approach.\nAdditional constraints for tailoring for the organization include large, safety-critical\nprojects and projects performed under contract. Large, safety-critical project tailoring\nsuggestions may require additional oversight and approval to help prevent errors, loss,\nor subsequent issues. Projects that are performed under contract may have contract\nterms that specify the use of a particular life cycle, delivery approach, or methodology.\nThe tailoring process shown in Figure 3-3 uses factors such as project size,\ncriticality, organizational maturity, and other considerations.\nFigure 3-3.

Therefore, internal\nproject tailoring might be approved by the project manager while tailoring changes that\nimpact external groups may require approval by the PMO or VDO. The PMO or VDO\ncan assist project teams as they tailor their approaches by providing ideas and solutions\nfrom other project teams.\nA VDO may be found in organizations that use more adaptive delivery\napproaches. The VDO serves an enabling role, rather than a management or\noversight function. It focuses on coaching project teams; building adaptive\nskills and capabilities throughout the organization; and mentoring sponsors and\nproduct owners to be more effective in those roles.\n3.4.3 TAILOR FOR THE PROJECT"

The items listed in this\nsection are not intended to be exhaustive or prescriptive, but rather to help project\nteams think about the options available to them.\nIn the context of this guide, terms are defined as follows:\nModel. A model is a thinking strategy to explain a process, framework, or\nphenomenon.\nMethod. A method is the means for achieving an outcome, output, result, or\nproject deliverable.\nArtifact. An artifact can be a template, document, output, or project deliverable.\nAs project teams consider the tailoring questions in Section 3.5 and decide on\nspecific responses to those questions, they will start to build a framework for\nstructuring their efforts to deliver the project outcomes. For example, project teams\nselect specific methods to enable capturing and sharing the applicable information so\nthey can track progress, improve project team performance in real time, and engage\nstakeholders.\nFigure 4-1 shows how tailoring includes the models and methods used to perform\nwork in the project performance domains. The deliverables and the artifacts are also\ntailored to the project, internal environment, and external environment."

A model helps to\nexplain how something works in the real world. Models can shape behavior and point\nto approaches for solving problems or meeting needs. Some models were developed\nwith projects and project teams in mind, others are more general in nature. Where\nfeasible, models in this section are presented as they apply to projects. The content in\nthis section does not describe how to develop or create new models.\nThe model descriptions presented provide a high-level view. Project team members\nand other stakeholders can refer to many sources (e.g., PMI's library of standards\nproducts and PMIstandards+™) for more-complete descriptions and explanations of the\nmodels.\n4.2.1 SITUATIONAL LEADERSHIP MODELS\nSituational leadership models are a subset of a vast array of leadership models.

      "content": "approaches, leadership styles are also tailored. Situational leadership models describe\nways to tailor one's leadership style to meet the needs of the individual and the project\nteam. The following are examples of two situational leadership models.\n4.2.1.1 Situational Leadership® II\nKen Blanchard's Situational Leadership® II measures project team member\ndevelopment using competence and commitment as the two main variables. Competence\nis the combination of ability, knowledge, and skill. Commitment speaks to the\nconfidence and motivation an individual has. As an individual's competence and\ncommitment evolve, leadership styles evolve from directing to coaching to supporting\nto delegating in order to meet the individual's needs.\n4.2.1.2 OSCAR Model\nThe OSCAR coaching and mentoring model was developed by Karen Whittleworth\nand Andrew Gilbert. It helps individuals adapt their coaching or leadership styles to\nsupport individuals who have an action plan for personal development. The model\nrefers to five contributing factors:\nOutcome. An outcome identifies the long-term goals of an individual and the\ndesired result from each conversation session.\nSituation. A situation enables conversation about the current skills, abilities, and\nknowledge level of the project team member; why the person is at that level; and\nhow that level impacts the individual's performance and peer relationships.\nChoices/consequences. Choice and/or consequences identify all the potential\navenues for attaining the desired outcome and the consequences of each choice so\nan individual can choose viable avenues for reaching their long-term goals.\nActions. An action commits to specific improvements by focusing on immediate\nand attainable targets that an individual can work toward within a specified time\nframe.\nReview. Holding regular meetings offers support and helps to ensure that\nindividuals remain motivated and on track.\n4.2.2 COMMUNICATION MODELS\nProject success is dependent on effective communication.

With the prevalence of multicultural project teams and\ndispersed stakeholders, these models provide a way of viewing communication styles\nand methods to enhance communication efficiency and effectiveness. There are many\ncommunication models that demonstrate different aspects of communication. Sections\n4.2.2.1 through 4.2.2.3 provide a sampling of communication models.\n4.2.2.1 Cross-Cultural Communication\nA communication model developed by Browaeys and Price incorporates the idea\nthat the message itself and how it is transmitted is influenced by the sender's current\nknowledge, experience, language, thinking, and communication styles, as well as\nstereotypes and relationship to the receiver. Similarly, the receiver's knowledge,\nexperience, language, thinking, and communication styles, as well as stereotypes and\nrelationship to the sender will influence how the message is interpreted.\n4.2.2.2 Effectiveness of Communication Channels\nAlistair Cockburn developed a model that describes the communication channels\nalong the axes of effectiveness and richness. As defined by Richard Daft and Robert\nLengel, richness relates to the amount of learning that can be transmitted through a\nmedium. Media richness is a function of characteristics, including the ability to:\nHandle multiple information cues simultaneously,\nFacilitate rapid feedback,\nEstablish a personal focus, and\nUtilize natural language.\nRichness in communication allows a broad spectrum of information to be conveyed\nrapidly. Situations that entail complex, complicated, and personal information benefit\nfrom richer communication channels, such as face-to-face communication. Situations\nthat impart simple, factual information can use less rich communication channels such as\na note or a text message.\n4.2.2.3 Gulf of Execution and Evaluation\nDonald Norman described the gulf of execution as the degree to which an item\ncorresponds with what a person expects it to do. Said another way, it is the difference\nbetween the intention of a user and what the item allows them to do or supports them in\ndoing.

Understanding what motivates project team members and other\nstakeholders helps to tailor rewards to the individual, thereby eliciting more effective\nengagement. There are a significant number of models that illustrate how people are\nmotivated. Four models are described in Sections 4.2.3.1 through 4.2.3.4, though these\nare a small representation of available models.\n4.2.3.1 Hygiene and Motivational Factors\nFrederick Herzberg conducted a study of motivational factors in working life. He\nbelieved that job satisfaction and dissatisfaction stem from conditions called\nmotivational factors. Motivational factors include matters that relate to the content of the\nwork, such as achievement, growth, and advancement. Insufficient motivational factors\nlead to dissatisfaction. Sufficient motivational factors lead to satisfaction.\nHerzberg also identified hygiene factors related to the work, such as company\npolicies, salary, and the physical environment. If hygiene factors are insufficient, they\ncause dissatisfaction. However, even if they are sufficient, they do not lead to\nsatisfaction.\n4.2.3.2 Intrinsic versus Extrinsic Motivation\nDaniel Pink published several books about the intrinsic factors that motivate people.\nHe stated that while extrinsic rewards, such as salary, are motivators to a certain extent,\nonce a person is paid fairly for their work, the motivational power of extrinsic rewards\nceases to exist. For complicated and challenging work, such as much of the work on\nprojects, intrinsic motivators are far longer lasting and more effective. Pink identifies\nthree types of intrinsic motivators: autonomy, mastery, and purpose:\nAutonomy. Autonomy is the desire to direct one's own life. This is aligned with\nbeing able to determine how, where, and when to accomplish work. Autonomy"

Knowing the project\nvision and how work contributes to achieving that vision allows people to feel\nlike they are making a difference.\n4.2.3.3 Theory of Needs\nDavid McClellan's model states that all people are driven by needs of achievement,\npower, and affiliation. The relative strength of each need depends on an individual's\nexperiences and culture.\nAchievement. People who are motivated by achievement, such as reaching a\ngoal, are motivated by activities and work that is challenging, but reasonable.\nPower. People who are motivated by power like to organize, motivate, and lead\nothers. They are motivated by increased responsibility.\nAffiliation. People who are motivated by affiliation seek acceptance and\nbelonging. They are motivated by being part of a team.\n4.2.3.4 Theory X, Theory Y, and Theory Z\nDouglas McGregor devised the Theory X and Theory Y models, which represent a\nspectrum of employee motivation and corresponding management styles. This was later\nexpanded to include Theory Z.\nTheory X. The X side of the spectrum assumes individuals work for the sole\npurpose of income. They are not ambitious or goal oriented. The corresponding\nmanagement style to motivate these individuals is a hands-on and top-down\napproach. This management style is often seen in a production or labor-intensive\nenvironment, or one with many layers of management.\nTheory Y. The Y side of the spectrum assumes that individuals are intrinsically\nmotivated to do good work. The corresponding management style has a more\npersonal coaching feel. The manager encourages creativity and discussion. This\nmanagement style is often seen in creative and knowledge worker environments.\nTheory Z. Abraham Maslow saw Theory Z as a transcendent dimension to work\nwhere individuals are motivated by self-realization, values, and a higher calling."

Managing this type of change requires thinking about how to\ntransition from the current to the future desired state. There are many models that\ndescribe the activities necessary for successful change management. Sections 4.2.4.1\nthrough 4.2.4.5 provide a sampling of the change models.\n4.2.4.1 Managing Change in Organizations\nManaging Change in Organizations: A Practice Guide [3] is an iterative model\nthat is based on common elements across a range of change management models. The\nframework has five associated elements interconnected through a series of feedback\nloops:\nFormulate change. This element focuses on building the rationale to help people\nunderstand why change is needed and how the future state will be better.\nPlan change. The identification of activities helps people prepare for the\ntransition from the current to the future state.\nImplement change. This iterative element focuses on demonstrating the future\nstate capabilities, checking to ensure the capabilities are having the intended\nimpact, and making necessary improvements or adaptations in response.\nManage transition. This element considers how to address needs related to the\nchange that may surface once the future state is achieved.\nSustain change. This element seeks to ensure that the new capabilities continue\nand previous processes or behaviors cease.\n4.2.4.2 ADKAR® Model\nJeff Hiatt developed the ADKAR® Model which focuses on five sequential steps\nthat individuals undergo when adapting to change:"

In this step, knowledge is supported with hands-on practice and\naccess to expertise and help as needed.\nStep 5: Reinforcement. Reinforcement supports the sustainment of the change.\nThis can include rewards, recognition, feedback, and measurement.\n4.2.4.3 The 8-Step Process for Leading Change\nJohn Kotter introduced the 8-Step Process for Leading Change for transforming\norganizations. It is a top-down approach where the need for and approach to change\noriginates at the top levels of the organization, and then is promoted down through the\norganization's layers of management to the change recipients. The eight steps are:\nStep 1: Create urgency. Identify potential threats and opportunities that drive\nthe need for change.\nStep 2: Form a powerful coalition. Identify the change leaders. Change leaders\nare not necessarily based on hierarchy. The change leaders should be influential\npeople from a variety of roles, expertise, social, and political importance.\nStep 3: Create a vision for change. Identify the values that are central to the\nchange. Then create a brief vision statement that summarizes the change. Next,\nidentify a strategy to realize the vision.\nStep 4: Communicate the vision. Communicate the vision throughout the change\nprocess. Apply the vision throughout all aspects of the organization. Senior\nmanagement and the change coalition should consistently communicate the vision\nand demonstrate the urgency and benefits of the change.\nStep 5: Remove obstacles. All change comes with obstacles. Sometimes the\nobstacles are outdated processes, sometimes they are based on the organizational\nstructure, and sometimes they are people resistant to change. Regardless, all\nobstacles need to be addressed.\nStep 6: Create short-term wins. Identify quick and easy wins to build\nmomentum and support for the change."

This initial stage is when everything feels familiar and can be\ncharacterized as “business as usual.” For some people, business as usual may be\ngood because they know what to expect. For others, this status may feel a bit stale\nor boring.\nThe foreign element. Something happens that shifts the status quo in this stage.\nThis may include initiating a project that introduces change to people's usual way\nof working. There is often a period of resistance and reduction in performance\nafter the change is introduced. People may ignore the change or dismiss its\nrelevance.\nChaos. People are in unfamiliar territory. They are no longer comfortable, and\nperformance drops to its lowest level. Feelings, actions, and behaviors are\nunpredictable. Some people feel anxious, others may shut down, and some\nindividuals may feel excited. Chaos can make people very creative as they try to\nfind ways to make sense of the situation. They try various ideas and behaviors to\nsee which of these has a positive outcome.\nThe transforming idea. People come to a point where they come up with an idea\nthat helps them make sense of the situation. They begin to see how they can find a\nway out of the chaos and cope with the new reality. Work performance begins to\nincrease.\nPractice and integration. People try to implement their new ideas or behaviors.\nThere may be setbacks and a period of trial and error, but eventually they learn\nwhat works and what doesn't. This leads to improved performance. Often\nperformance is at a higher level than it was before the foreign element was\nintroduced."

Eventually, the new status quo becomes the normal way of working.\n4.2.4.5 Transition Model\nWilliam Bridges’ Transition Model provides an understanding of what occurs to\nindividuals psychologically when an organizational change takes place. This model\ndifferentiates between change and transition. Change is situational and happens whether\nor not people transition through it. Transition is a psychological process where people\ngradually accept the details of the new situation and the changes that come with it.\nThe model identifies three stages of transition associated with change:\nEnding, losing, and letting go. The change is introduced in this stage. It is often\nassociated with fear, anger, upset, uncertainty, denial, and resistance to the\nchange.\nThe neutral zone. The change is happening in this stage. In some instances,\npeople may feel frustration, resentment, confusion, and anxiety about the change.\nProductivity may drop as people learn new ways of doing work. In other\ninstances, people may become very creative, innovative, and passionate about\ntrying new ways of working.\nThe new beginning. At this point, people accept and even embrace the change.\nThey are becoming more adept at the new skills and the new ways of working.\nPeople are often open to learning and are energized by the change.\n4.2.5 COMPLEXITY MODELS\nProjects exist in a state of ambiguity and require interactions among multiple\nsystems, often with uncertain outcomes. Complexity is a challenge to work with. The\ntwo models described in Sections 4.2.5.1 and 4.2.5.2 provide a framework to\nunderstand complexity and determine how to make decisions in a complex environment.\n4.2.5.1 Cynefin Framework\nThe Cynefin framework, created by Dave Snowden, is a conceptual framework used\nto diagnose cause-and-effect relationships as a decision-making aid. The framework\noffers five problem and decision-making contexts:\nWhere there is an obvious cause-and-effect relationship, best practices are used\nto make decisions."

In these situations, it is best to assess the facts, analyze\nthe situation, and apply good practices.\nComplex relationships include unknown unknowns. There is no apparent cause\nand effect, and there are no obvious right answers. In complex environments, one\nshould probe the environment, sense the situation, and respond with action. This\nstyle uses emergent practices that allow for repeated cycles of probe-sense-\nrespond as complex environments change in reaction to multiple stimuli, and\nwhat worked once may not be effective the next time.\nIn chaotic environments, the cause and effects are unclear. There is too much\nconfusion to wait to understand the situation. In these situations, the first step is to\ntake action to try and stabilize the situation, then sense where there is some\nstability, and respond by taking steps to get the chaotic situation to a complex\nsituation.\nDisordered relationships lack clarity and may require breaking them into smaller\nparts whose context links with one of the other four contexts.\nThe Cynefin framework helps identify behaviors, such as probing, sensing,\nresponding, acting, and categorizing, which can help impact the relationships between\nvariables and guide actions.\n4.2.5.2 Stacey Matrix\nRalph Stacey developed the Stacey matrix which is similar to the Cynefin\nframework, but it looks at two dimensions to determine the relative complexity of a\nproject: (a) the relative uncertainty of the requirements for the deliverable, and (b) the\nrelative uncertainty of the technology that will be used to create the deliverable. Based\non the relative uncertainty of these dimensions, a project is considered simple,\ncomplicated, complex, or chaotic. The degree of complexity is one factor that influences\ntailoring methods and practices for the project.\n4.2.6 PROJECT TEAM DEVELOPMENT MODELS\nProject teams move through different stages of development. Understanding the\nstage of the team in its development helps project managers support the project team\nand its growth. The two models presented in Sections 4.2.6.1 and 4.2.6.2 illustrate how\nproject teams move through different stages to become high-performing project teams.\n4.2.6.1 Tuckman Ladder"

This might occur in the kickoff meeting.\nStorming. Project team members jockey for position on the team. This phase is\nwhere people's personalities, strengths, and weaknesses start to come out. There\nmight be some conflict or struggle as people figure out how to work together.\nStorming might go on for some time or pass relatively quickly.\nNorming. The project team starts to function as a collective body. At this point,\nproject team members know their places on the team and how they relate to and\ninterface with all the other members. They are starting to work together. There\nmight be some challenges as work progresses, but these issues are resolved\nquickly, and the project team moves into action.\nPerforming. The project team becomes operationally efficient. This is the mature\nproject team stage. Project teams that have been together for a while are able to\ndevelop a synergy. By working together, project team members accomplish more\nand produce a high-quality product.\nAdjourning. The project team completes the work and disperses to work on\nother things. If the project team has formed good relationships, some project team\nmembers might be sad about leaving the project team.\nThe project team culture in this model starts in the forming stage and evolves\nthroughout the rest of the development stages. While this model shows a linear\nprogression, project teams can move back and forth between theses stages. In addition,\nnot all project teams achieve the performing or even the norming stages.\n4.2.6.2 Drexler/Sibbet Team Performance Model\nAllan Drexler and David Sibbet developed a team performance model with seven\nsteps. Steps 1 through 4 describe the stages in creating a project team, and steps 5\nthrough 7 cover project team sustainability and performance.\nStep 1: Orientation. Orientation answers the question of why. In this stage, the\nproject team learns the purpose and mission for the project. This usually occurs\nat a kickoff meeting, or is documented in a business case, project charter, or lean\nstart-up canvas."

      "content": "lead to dissatisfaction, lack of trust, and reduced morale and motivation. The model\nbased on work by Ken Thomas and Ralph Kilmann describes six ways of addressing\nconflict by focusing on the relative power between the individuals and the desire to\nmaintain a good relationship as follows:\nConfronting/problem solving. Confronting a conflict treats the conflict as a\nproblem to be solved. This style of conflict resolution is used when the\nrelationship between parties is important, and when each person has confidence\nin the other party's ability to problem-solve.\nCollaborating. Collaborating involves incorporating multiple views about the\nconflict. The objective is to learn about the various views and see things from\nmultiple perspectives. This is an effective method when there is trust among the\nparticipants and when there is time to come to consensus. A project manager may\nfacilitate this type of conflict resolution between project team members.\nCompromising. There are some conflicts in which all parties will not be fully\nsatisfied. In those instances, finding a way to compromise is the best approach.\nCompromise entails a willingness to give and take. This allows all parties to get\nsomething they want, and it avoids escalating the conflict. This style is often used\nwhen the parties involved have equal “power.” A project manager may\ncompromise with a technical manager regarding the availability of a project team\nmember to work on the project.\nSmoothing/accommodating. Smoothing and accommodating are useful when\nreaching the overarching goal is more important than the disagreement. This\napproach maintains harmony in the relationship and can create good will between\nthe parties. This approach is also used when there is a difference in the relative\nauthority or power of the individuals. For example, this approach may be\nappropriate when there is a disagreement with the sponsor. Since the sponsor\noutranks the project manager or project team member, and there is a desire to\nmaintain a good relationship with the sponsor, adopting an accommodating\nposture may be appropriate.\nForcing. Forcing is used when there is not enough time to collaborate or\nproblem-solve. In this scenario, one party forces their will on the other. The party\nforcing has more power than the other party. A forcing style may be used if there\nis a health and safety conflict that needs to be resolved immediately.\nWithdrawal/avoiding. Sometimes a problem will go away on its own, or\nsometimes discussions get heated and people need a cooling-off period. In both\nscenarios, withdrawing from the situation is appropriate. Withdrawal is also\nused in a no-win scenario, such as complying with a requirement imposed by a\nregulatory agency instead of challenging the requirement."

One model is Steven Covey's principle of\n“Think Win-Win.” This principle applies to all interactions, not just negotiations, but it\nis described here in the context of negotiation. In negotiations, there are different\npossible outcomes:\nWin-win. This is the optimal outcome, where each person is satisfied with the\noutcome.\nWin-lose/lose-win. This describes a competition perspective where in order to\nwin, someone else loses. It may also come from a martyr perspective where\nsomeone chooses to lose so that others can win.\nLose-lose. This outcome can occur when win-win outcomes may have been\npossible, but competition overwhelms collaboration. In this scenario, everyone\nends up worse off.\nA win-win perspective is generally found when the following aspects are present:\nCharacter. The parties involved are mature, demonstrate integrity, and share the\nperspective that there is enough value for everybody.\nTrust. The parties trust each other, establish agreements on how to operate, and\nare accountable.\nApproach. Each party is willing to look at the situation from the other's point of\nview. The parties work together to identify key issues and concerns. They\nidentify what an acceptable solution looks like and identify options to achieve an\nacceptable solution.\n4.2.7.3 Planning\nBarry Boehm developed a model that compares the time and effort invested in\ndeveloping plans to reduce risk, including the delay and other costs associated with\noverplanning. By taking more time to plan up front, many projects can reduce\nuncertainty, oversights, and rework. However, the longer the time spent planning, the\nlonger it takes to get a return on investment, the more market share could be lost, and the\nmore circumstances can change by the time the output is delivered. The intent of this\nmodel is to help identify the optimum amount of planning, sometimes called the sweet\nspot. The sweet spot is different for every project; therefore, there is no correct answer\nfor the right amount of planning overall. This model demonstrates that there is a point\nwhere additional planning becomes counterproductive."

The Process Groups interact within\neach phase of a project life cycle. It is possible that all of these processes could occur\nwithin a single phase. Processes may be iterated within a phase or life cycle. The\nnumber of iterations and interactions between processes varies based on the needs of\nthe project.\nProjects that follow a process-based approach may use the following five process\ngroupings as an organizing structure:\nInitiating. Those processes performed to define a new project or a new phase of\nan existing project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase.\nPlanning. Those processes required to establish the scope of the project, refine\nthe objectives, and define the course of action required to attain the objectives\nthat the project was undertaken to achieve.\nExecuting. Those processes performed to complete the work defined in the\nproject management plan to satisfy the project requirements.\nMonitoring and Controlling. Those processes required to track, review, and\nregulate the progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which\nchanges to the plan are required; and initiate the corresponding changes.\nClosing. Those processes performed to formally complete or close a project,\nphase, or contract.\nThese Process Groups are independent of the delivery approach, application areas\n(such as marketing, information services, and accounting), or industry (such as\nconstruction, aerospace, and telecommunications). In a process-based approach, the\noutput of one process generally becomes an input to another process or is a deliverable\nof the project or project phase. For example, a project management plan and project\ndocuments, such as the risk register, assumption log, etc., which are produced in the\nplanning process grouping, are inputs to the executing process grouping where updates\nare made to associated artifacts.\n4.2.7.5 Salience Model\nThe Salience Model is about stakeholders.

This appendix describes the actions and\nimpacts of sponsors and how these factors contribute to the overall success of the\nproject.\nX2.2 THE SPONSOR ROLE\nDepending on the organization, a project typically has a sponsor. The project\nsponsor provides decision leadership that is outside of the authority and position power\nof the project manager and project team. Active engagement and oversight by a project\nsponsor supports the project manager, the project team, and ultimately drives project\noutcomes. The sponsor also links the project team with the strategy and big-picture\nview at the executive level of the organization.\nSponsors perform the following functions, among others:\nCommunicate the vision, goals, and expectations to the team.\nAdvocate for the project and the team.\nFacilitate executive-level decisions.\nHelp secure resources.\nKeep projects aligned to business objectives.\nRemove obstacles.\nAddress issues outside the project team's authority.\nBring opportunities that arise within the project to senior management."

When the market, competition, and strategy are\nvolatile and evolving, this may require frequent interactions to adjust project\nwork to meet the evolving direction.\nCustomer focus. Balance various stakeholder needs and priorities. When there\nare multiple stakeholders, especially stakeholders with conflicting needs, it may\nbe necessary to prioritize stakeholder needs and make trade-offs.\nDecisions. Make decisions or direct decisions to the appropriate individual or\ngroup when there are decisions to be made that are outside of the project team's\nauthority. If the team cannot come to a decision or if the team is in conflict,\nsponsors can mediate conflict and facilitate the decision-making process.\nMotivation. Sponsors serve as a source of motivation for the project team by\nactively engaging with and supporting them.\nAccountability. Depending on the authority level of the role, sponsors are often\naccountable for the project outcomes. In this role, they may accept or reject the\ndeliverables for the project.\nX2.3 LACK OF ENGAGEMENT\nWhen the sponsor is not engaged or when that role is vacant, many of the benefits\nassociated with the activities listed in Section X2.2 are missing. This may have a\nnegative impact on project effectiveness. Project performance suffers because there are\noften longer decision time frames and conflicting priorities. If the sponsor is not helping\nto secure resources, that gap can impact access to necessary team members or\nacquisition of physical resources. When there is no direct sponsor support, team\nmembers may be removed or switched out. These changes can cause negative impacts to\nscope, quality, schedule, and budget and diminish the probability of achieving intended\noutcomes and stakeholder satisfaction.\nX2.4 SPONSOR BEHAVIORS"

In the context of the PMBOK® Guide – Seventh Edition, the project management\noffice (PMO) represents a management structure that standardizes project-related\ngovernance processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, tools, methodologies, and\ntechniques. Recognizing that the character and function of a PMO varies between\norganizations, and even within the same organization, this appendix outlines common\nattributes among PMOs and discusses how PMOs support project work.\nX3.2 THE PMO VALUE PROPOSITION—WHY HAVE\nONE?\nOrganizations establish PMOs for a variety of reasons but with one core benefit in\nmind: improved project management in terms of schedule, cost, quality, risk, and other\nfacets. PMOs have many potential roles in aligning work with strategic goals: engaging\nand collaborating with stakeholders, developing talent, and realizing value from\ninvestments in projects.\nPMOs can take multiple forms. Understanding how PMOs are utilized in\norganizations as well as assigned roles and responsibilities sheds light on the range of\nbenefits PMOs can deliver:\nSome PMOs provide project management guidance that supports consistency in\nhow projects are delivered. These PMOs may provide guidelines, templates, and\nexamples of good practices along with training and coaching. Standardized\napproaches and tools promote a common business picture across projects and\nfacilitate decisions that transcend individual project concerns. This type of PMO\noften exists in organizations that are just starting to improve their project\nmanagement capabilities."

      "content": "A PMO may offer project support services for planning activities, risk\nmanagement, project performance tracking, and similar activities. This shared\nservices model of a PMO often exists in organizations with independent or\ndiverse business units that want support with delivery while maintaining more\ndirect control over their projects.\nPMOs can be part of a department or business unit and oversee a portfolio of\nprojects. Oversight can include such activities as requiring a business case to\ninitiate a project, allocating financial and other resources to deliver the project,\napproving requests to change project scope or activities, and similar functions.\nThis type of PMO provides centralized management of projects. This structure\nexists in organizations that have departments with multiple projects and that\ndeliver strategically important results, such as IT capabilities or new product\ndevelopment.\nAn organization may have an enterprise-level PMO (EPMO) that links\nimplementation of organizational strategy with portfolio-level investments in\nprograms and projects that deliver specific results, changes, or products. This\nstructure exists in organizations with well-established project management\ncapabilities that are directly linked to achieving organizational strategy and\nbroad business objectives.\nOrganizations with flatter structures, customer-centered initiatives, and more\nadaptive delivery approaches may adopt an Agile Center of Excellence (ACoE)\nor Value Delivery Office (VDO) structure. The ACoE/VDO serves an enabling\nrole, rather than a management or oversight function. It focuses on coaching\nteams, building agile skills and capabilities throughout the organization, and\nmentoring sponsors and product owners to be more effective in those roles. This\ntype of structure is emerging within organizations adopting more decentralized\nstructures where teams need to respond quickly to changing customer needs.\nPMOs may be layered. For example, an EPMO may have subordinate PMOs and\nVDOs that reside within specific departments. Such layering supports strategic\nalignment at the EPMO level and specific project management capabilities within the\ndepartmental PMO or VDO.\nThe formation of any type of PMO or VDO is based on organizational needs. Key\ninfluencers that help to shape the PMO or VDO include the types of projects being\ndelivered, the size of the organization, its structure(s), the degree of\ncentralized/decentralized decision making, and corporate culture. As organizational\nneeds change over time, PMOs and VDOs evolve in response. For example, a PMO\nmay transform into a VDO or the PMO may be closed after fulfilling its charter."

      "content": "X3.3 KEY PMO CAPABILITIES\nThe Standard for Project Management states that projects are part of a system for\nvalue delivery within organizations. PMOs can support that system and are a part of the\nsystem. Just as project teams need specific capabilities to deliver results, so do PMOs.\nEffective PMOs make three key contributions that support value delivery:\nFostering delivery and outcomes-oriented capabilities. PMOs foster project\nmanagement capabilities. They ensure that employees, contractors, partners, etc.,\nwho are within and outside of the PMO, understand, develop, apply, and value a\nrange of project management skills and competencies. They focus on right-sizing\nprocesses and governance, based on the unique characteristics of each project to\nproduce high-quality results efficiently, quickly, and effectively.\nKeeping the “big picture” perspective. Staying true to the goals of a project\nremains a key element of success. Scope creep and new priorities not aligned to\nstrategic or business goals can allow projects to drift off course. Strong PMOs\nevaluate the performance of projects with an eye toward continuous\nimprovement. They evaluate work in the context of the organization's overall\nsuccess rather than maximizing a specific project's results. They provide project\nteams, senior management, and business leaders with information and guidance\nthat help them understand current circumstances and options in support of\ndecision making.\nContinuous improvement, knowledge transfer, and change management.\nStrong PMOs regularly share project results across the organization to transfer\nvaluable knowledge gained from each project. Learning and sharing activities\ninform strategic and business objectives while improving activities that\nstrengthen future project delivery. Effective organizational change management\nbuilds and sustains alignment with process updates, capability enhancements, and\nnew skills that support project management.\nX3.4 EVOLVING FOR STRONGER BENEFITS\nREALIZATION\nFor many businesses, greater uncertainty, an accelerated pace of change, increased\ncompetition, and more empowered customers mean organizations produce value in an\nincreasingly complex environment. The ability to implement new strategic initiatives\nand change rapidly is becoming a key differentiator. These changes are also exerting\ngreater pressure on PMOs to demonstrate their contributions to benefits realization and\nvalue creation. PMOs are evolving to meet these challenges by:"

The shift away from local branches and toward microlending with\nfunding in smaller batches is based on evaluation of value delivered.\nStart-ups.

Work is more distributed,\nfragmented, and fluid than with traditional models.\nMedia. A move away from buying DVDs and CDs from centralized outlets;\ninstead, a rise in subscription services with ongoing funding and delivery of\nbenefits.\nX4.3 IMPACT ON PROJECT DELIVERY PRACTICES\nAs markets shift from a single project delivery model to an ongoing delivery model,\nsome organizations are looking for alternatives to temporary project structures that\ndeliver a single product, change, or service. Instead, they are looking for delivery\nconstructs that have a strong customer focus, recognize the rapid evolution of\ntechnology, and align with the ongoing service and revenue streams of loyal customers.\nThese factors have led to an increased interest in and shift toward product\nmanagement life cycles for value delivery. Product management takes a longer life cycle\nview that encompasses support, sustainment, and ongoing evolution with the same team.\nStable teams are especially valuable in complex and unique domains, such as systems\nwith embedded software where knowledge transfer is time-consuming and costly. The\nshifting focus to product management is prompting some project-oriented organizations\nto adapt their delivery models.\nX4.4 ORGANIZATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR\nPRODUCT MANAGEMENT\nOrganizations that are shifting to long-running, product-based environments can\nutilize several strategies to align and coordinate product management.

Instead of disbanding the team when initial development\nis complete, use that team to sustain and evolve the product with the designated\nproduct owner or person within the team reflecting the customer perspective.\nThis removes the need for knowledge transfer and reduces the risk of future\nenhancements being delayed due to a loss of tacit knowledge.\nLong-standing teams also develop better market awareness, customer insights,\nand customer empathy than short-term teams. This helps with maintaining\ncustomer focus and customer loyalty and builds competitive advantage. When\npeople know they will be responsible for maintaining and enhancing a product,\nthey are less likely to take shortcuts to get something ready for release. As a\nresult, quality, maintainability, and extensibility are often improved with long-\nserving teams rather than with teams that develop then handover products. These\nfactors, in turn, contribute to creating value and sustaining value delivery.\nPartners or contractors who develop initial products for deployment on a\ncustomer site incorporate effective change management to ensure customers have\nthe capabilities to maintain the product once it is transitioned. Part of transition\nplanning can include discussions on building a team within the receiving\norganization that can support and evolve the product over its life cycle."

Instead of predefined project durations\nor annual budgets, consider more frequent reviews (such as quarterly) and\nfunding for the next quarter. With more frequent evaluations and funding, the\nbusiness is in closer control of overall progress, direction, and decision making.\nSimilar to venture capital funding, regular reviews of delivered value allow\ndirect funding toward products that are providing expected value and reduce or\ncurtail investment in underperforming initiatives. Such funding models enable\norganizations to pursue new market opportunities and capitalize on successful\nendeavors while limiting exposure to the inevitable percentage of new initiatives\nthat fail.\nUtilize program management structures. Practitioners operating with stable\nteams that support customer-centric products can apply program management\nconstructs for managing long-running initiatives. Programs align well with\nadjusting to market changes and focusing on customer benefits. They are also\ntypically much longer running than a single project.\nThe Standard for Program Management addresses ongoing priority changes as\nfollows: “The primary difference between projects and programs is based on the\nrecognition within programs that the strategies for delivering benefits may need\nto be optimized adaptively as the outcomes of components are individually\nrealized. The best mechanisms for delivering a program's benefits may initially\nbe ambiguous or uncertain.”\nThis acceptance of up-front uncertainty, need for adaptation, focus on benefits,\nand longer time frames may make programs a better fit than projects for many\norganizations managing product delivery.\nMany traditional product industries, such as infrastructure, aerospace, and\nautomotive, use program management guides and frameworks. These industries\nutilize programs for directional alignment and integration of component\nactivities, such as programs, subprograms, and project activities. For example,\nan organization with a technology platform can use program and product\nmanagement to prioritize and oversee capabilities that will maximize the\nplatform's return on investment over its lifetime. A stable, continuous\ndevelopment team can work on customer-focused, value-adding features and\nfunctions. Project teams then deliver equipment upgrades and interfaces with new\nor enhanced systems. Operational teams can troubleshoot user interface issues\nand help customers adapt to new features. When program structures already exist\nin organizations, shifting to those structures for product management does not\nrequire reorienting everyone to a new way of thinking or working."

Content includes:\nRationale for a move to a principle-based standard,\nOverview of the research conducted prior to the development of the standard,\nDescription of how the standard was developed, and\nInformation on how the content in the standard was validated.\nX5.2 THE MOVE TO A PRINCIPLE-BASED\nSTANDARD\nSince 2010, PMI's standards program has included research in addition to\npractitioner experience to develop standards. Academic research, market research,\nfocus groups, and practitioner experience have been inputs when updating many of the\nstandards documents, including The Standard for Project Management.\nAs early as 2012, research suggested a move away from a prescriptive, process-\noriented standard toward one that requires reflection to apply in practice. Since that\ntime, many of PMI's standards have moved to a principle-based format, such as The\nStandard for Program Management – Third Edition and The Standard for Portfolio\nManagement – Fourth Edition. In addition, as part of supporting the development of\nISO standards, PMI participated in discussions within ISO TC2581 regarding the need\nto shift to a narrative- or principle-based approach and away from a process-based\napproach."

This research helped to identify common practice areas and\nthemes that served as inputs into developing the principles in the The Standard\nfor Project Management.\nPMI research, such as Pulse of the Profession®, which indicated that more\norganizations and practitioners are embracing agile and hybrid models along with\nnew ways of working (i.e., tools, frameworks, technologies, etc.).\nReview of published white papers, thought leadership articles, and related\ndocuments to elicit underlying principles.\nFocus groups and workshops to gather stakeholder input for improving the\nusability of The Standard for Project Management.\nAnalysis of the research led to the conclusion that more organizations are embracing\na variety of project management approaches. Some organizations are moving toward a\nhybrid approach which mixes predictive and adaptive practices. Organizations and\nproject teams are tailoring their approaches to the needs of the industry, organization,\nand project. These findings indicated that the PMI standard needed to reflect a more\nholistic and inclusive view of project management applicable to predictive, hybrid, and\nadaptive approaches.\nAll of this information contributed insights to the development process for\nexploring:\nA shift from a process- to a principle-based focus that would reflect the full\nspectrum of the various ways that projects are managed.\nPotential new content areas for inclusion, such as benefits realization\nmanagement, organizational change management, and complexity, in alignment"

Approximately 450 individuals applied to participate on\nthe teams. Twelve people were selected for the Development Team and approximately\n70 were selected to participate in one of two review teams. The Development Team\nand review teams were comprised of stakeholders from around the globe and across\nindustry segments and roles (e.g., government, practitioners, academic, consulting, and\norganizational providers). The teams included expertise in delivering projects using\npredictive, hybrid, and adaptive approaches.\nX5.4.2 CONTENT\nThe standard is comprised of three sections: Introduction, A System for Value\nDelivery, and Project Management Principles.\nThe Introduction includes key terms and concepts associated with project\nmanagement. Much of this information is consistent with previous editions.\nContent in the section on A System for Value Delivery draws on content from PMI\nfoundational standards2 as well as research on benefits realization management and\norganizational agility. The content is presented with a focus on delivering value and is\ninclusive of the various ways in which value is created.\nThe Project Management Principles section evolved throughout the development\nand validation process. The initial concepts for the principles were identified through\nthe research discussed previously. The Development Team worked individually and\ncollaboratively to identify potential principles and then grouped them into affinity"

The potential categories and keywords were\ncomposed into an initial draft, which was then reviewed and commented on by the\nentire Development Team to ensure the intent of the principles was reflected in the\ndraft.\nIt is important to note that the principles are intended to be broadly based. Nothing\nin the principles is intended to be dogmatic, restrictive, or prescriptive. The principles\nare aligned with, but not duplicative of, the content in the PMI Code of Ethics and\nProfessional Conduct.\nIt is not possible to generate the “right principles” as each project and organization\nis different. Therefore, the principles are designed as a guide for people working on\nprojects. Project professionals and others working on projects can seek to be aligned\nwith the principles, but they are not intended to provide instructions for managing\nprojects.\nX5.5 VALIDATING THE STANDARD\nContent in the standard was validated using three main approaches: global\nworkshops, iterative development, and public exposure draft.\nX5.5.1 GLOBAL WORKSHOPS\nThroughout the development process, global workshops were held where the move\nto a principle-based standard was presented and workshop participants were asked to\nexplore guiding principles for project management. Workshops were presented in\nDublin, Ireland (PMI Global Congress – EMEA); Bangalore, India; Brazilia, Brazil;\nOttawa, Canada (PMI Global Executive Council meeting); Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,\nUnited States (PMI Global Conference); and Beijing, China. These workshops served\nas input into the Development Team's work and as validation checkpoints during\ndevelopment.\nX5.5.2 ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT\nThe Development Team worked in pairs and small teams to develop the initial\ncontent for each of the three sections that comprise The Standard for Project\nManagement. Once the initial drafts were integrated, the Development Team and\nReview Team 1 reviewed and commented on the drafts of each section of the standard.\nThese reviews produced over a thousand comments which the Development Team"

Almost 600 individuals submitted comments on the\nexposure draft. In response to the exposure draft comments, the content was reorganized\nand edited for clarity.

The Development Team then reviewed the draft of the\nstandard and gave approval for the draft to go to the Standards Consensus Committee\nfor consensus ballot per PMI's Policy for the Development and Coordination of\nAmerican National Standards.\nX5.6 SUMMARY\nContinuing changes in the project management profession and the ways in which\nprojects are managed support a less prescriptive standard. Industry research, global\nparticipation with broad industry representation, and an iterative review process\nshaped and validated the move from a process-based standard to a principle-based\nstandard.

Organizations face the challenge of\nchanging and improving their services, products, and operations to survive and compete. Projects are a\nmeans by which organizations can rise to this challenge.\nPRINCE2® is the globally recognized project management method, built upon years of experience and\nindustry best practice, from which all organizations can benefit. It has been tried and tested by private,\npublic, and third-sector organizations to successfully deliver new products and services, and to bring\nabout transformational change.\nThis guidance shows practitioners how the PRINCE2 principles, practices, and processes, in addition to\npeople, are the foundation of effective project management. It explains how the method can be\nadapted and tailored to fit any context, regardless of the project’s purpose, scale, type, organization,\ngeography, or culture.\nThe five integrated elements of PRINCE2 are also extremely relevant for anyone interested in\ndeveloping essential project management skills, whatever their role.\nThe global adoption of PRINCE2 provides a universal language that unites project teams with\nstakeholders across different sectors, organizations, and national boundaries.\nPRINCE2 creates the conditions crucial for project success by fostering a common understanding of why\na project is being delivered, defining all roles and responsibilities within the project team, and\ncommunicating the benefits to be realized to everyone involved. It also helps organizations control and\nmanage all of these aspects more effectively.\nWe are confident that PRINCE2 7 will equip current and aspiring project managers with the foundations\nto successfully lead and manage any and all projects.\nxi"

      "title": "Preface",
      "content": "Preface\nSince its first launch in 1996, each iteration of PRINCE2 has provided a universal project management\nmethod. It has reflected project management practice of the time; it has also pushed the boundaries of\nbest practice. For example, the 2009 version introduced, among other things, the principle of learning\nfrom experience based on a ‘pull’ rather than ‘push’ approach. This edition is no different; the method\nhas been updated to reflect how project management has evolved over the past six or so years, as it\nalso seeks to push the boundaries of best practice through the introduction of new aspects of project\nmanagement.\nIt was apparent from research and consultation that there was a need to include how projects address\nsustainability issues, use data analytics and digital technology, and ensure the ‘people’ aspects of\nproject management is handled with as much care as the process aspects. These are no longer an\noptional add-on to the method, or even ‘nice to have’; these are now fully integrated into the method.\nThere can be a tendency when updating guidance to simply add new material to the existing content,\nresulting in more rather than better guidance. Instead, the decision was made to go back to basics and\nchallenge every aspect of PRINCE2, ensuring that its inclusion was required and contributed to the\nguidance being fit for purpose currently and for years to come.\nThe research and consultation also gave a strong message: that the core PRINCE2 method was still valid\nand relevant, but it could be improved to better express this core method. The task was to transform\nthe way that PRINCE2 is explained, retaining all that makes the method invaluable, and introducing its\nnew aspects. The essence of what a project is remains the same; it is temporary, it is product-focused,\nand there should always be an ongoing business justification.\nThis edition has been designed with the following philosophy:\n● to ensure that PRINCE2 remains adaptable and flexible, and can be used for all types of projects in a\nwide range of organizations and environments\n● to provide guidance that retains and strengthens all the aspects of PRINCE2 that remain valid, while\nadding new complementary content in a way that maintains and builds on the integrity of the\nintegrated framework\n● to not replicate guidance that is provided in other methods such as Managing Successful\nProgrammes (MSP) and Management of Risk (M_o_R 4), but instead to offer additional value to\nanyone involved in a project\n● to emphasize how PRINCE2 is designed to be applied and tailored appropriately according to the\nproject environment and the project requirements\n● to enable project teams to recognize the many ways that outputs can be delivered, including iterative\n(agile), linear, and hybrid approaches.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the team I have worked with closely over the past months:\nJohn Edmonds and his colleagues at PeopleCert, PRINCE2 examiners, numerous reviewers, and my\nteam of authors, notably Tanja Van Den Akker, Brad Bigelow, Jo Lucas, Henny Portman, Richard Rose,\nMarisa Silva, and Sue Taylor. Finally, it only remains for me to wish you, the readers, every success with\ndelivering successful change through the use of PRINCE2 in project management.\nAndy Murray\nxii"

It is a structured\nproject management method that uses the experience gained from thousands of projects, as well as\ncontributions from countless project sponsors, project managers, project teams, academics, trainers,\nand consultants.\nPRINCE2 has been designed to be adaptable so that it can be applied to any project, regardless of the\nproject’s purpose, scale, type, organization, geography, or culture. This is achieved by:\n● separating the management of the project from the specialist development activities, such as design\nor construction, allowing any specialist activities to be integrated into a controlled environment for\nthe project\n● focusing on what needs to be done to manage the project, rather than prescribing how work is done\n● requiring that the method is established specifically for the needs and context of the project by the\nway it is applied and tailored.\n1.1.1 Purpose of this book\nThis book is intended for anyone involved in a project that uses PRINCE2, is considering using PRINCE2,\nor is looking to develop their project management skills. It is designed for the following roles:\n● entry-level project management personnel wishing to learn about project management generally\nand the PRINCE2 method in particular\n● experienced project management professionals\n● anyone undertaking a PRINCE2 role on a project, such as a project executive\n● PRINCE2 project managers who need a detailed reference source\n● project office managers who have adopted the method for their organization or are intending to do\nso and require a source of information\n● agile practitioners who wish to use PRINCE2 to establish appropriate project controls for their work\n● any personnel desiring to develop essential project management skills to improve their effectiveness.\n2"

These questions include:\n● What is expected of me, and what should I expect from others on the project?\n● What project decisions am I expected to make?\n● What information do I need to supply, and what information should I receive?\n● What should I do if things do not go to plan?\n● Who should I look to for support or for direction?\n● How can we apply and tailor the use of PRINCE2 for our project?\nIt is not intended (or possible) for PRINCE2 to cover every aspect of project management. There are two\nbroad topics that are deliberately considered to be outside the scope of PRINCE2: specialist aspects of\nproject work and detailed project management techniques.\n1.1.1.1 Specialist aspects of project work\nPRINCE2’s strength is its flexibility and the fact that it is not specific to a particular industry, type of\nproject, commercial model, project lifecycle, delivery method, product development, or engineering\npractice. PRINCE2 regards these as specialist aspects of the project work and provides a means for\nthem to be fully integrated into the management approaches to be used by the project.\n1.1.1.2 Detailed project management techniques\nThere are many proven project management techniques that can be used in support of the PRINCE2\nmethod. For example, release planning, user stories, Kanban, timeboxing, retrospectives, critical path\nanalysis, and earned value management. This book highlights various techniques that support the\nPRINCE2 practices, but they are not documented in detail in this book as they are already described and\nmaintained elsewhere in various bodies of knowledge.\nTechniques are only described in detail if PRINCE2 specifically recommends that particular approach, or\nthe approach is unique to PRINCE2, such as PRINCE2’s planning technique. Alternative (yet equivalent)\ntechniques can be substituted, or additional techniques included if the chosen techniques are\nexplained in the project initiation documentation.\n1.2 Structure of the official book\nPRINCE2 is a project management method composed of five integrated elements: principles, people,\npractices, processes, and the project context (figure 1.1).\n3"

There are seven principles, and unless all of them are\napplied, it is not a PRINCE2 project. The PRINCE2 principles are explained in Chapter 2.\n● People Projects need people, mainly those working on the project and those affected by the\nproject. An understanding of the needs, capabilities, and motivations of the people involved and the\nrelationships between them is crucial to how the project is established and managed. How people\nare put at the centre of the method is described in Chapter 3.\n● PRINCE2 practices The practices describe essential aspects of project management that must be\napplied consistently and throughout the project lifecycle. The seven practices explain the specific\ntreatment required of that aspect of project management for the PRINCE2 processes to be effective\nand why they are necessary. The PRINCE2 practices are covered in Chapters 4 to 11.\n● PRINCE2 processes The seven processes describe the entire project lifecycle, from activities before\ngetting started, through the stages of project delivery, and to the final act of project closure. Each\nprocess has checklists of recommended activities and related responsibilities. The PRINCE2\nprocesses are provided in Chapters 12 to 19.\n● The project context The principles, practices, and processes are applied by the people involved to\nensure that the method is fit for the project context. How PRINCE2 can be applied to common\ncontexts is outlined in section 1.4.\nAppendix A provides a summary of management products (such as the business case) used in the\npractices and processes. Appendix B provides a summary of PRINCE2 roles. The glossary summarizes\nthe PRINCE2 defined terms that are used throughout the official book. Throughout this official book, we\nrefer to the organization that commissions the project as the ‘business’.\n4"

The\npractices ensure that the principles are continually applied during the processes in a way that\nis specific to the project context and consider the relationships and requirements of people\nwithin the project team and those outside the project team.\n1.3 What is a project?\nA key challenge that organizations face is balancing two competing needs, which are:\n● maintaining current business operations, also known as business as usual (such as maintaining\nprofitability, service quality, customer relationships, brand loyalty, productivity, and market\nconfidence)\n● improving or transforming business operations to survive and compete in the future, also known as\nbusiness change (for example, anticipating and deciding how change can be introduced to the\ngreatest effect).\nAs the pace of change accelerates (whether technological, business, social, or regulatory), and the need\nto adapt becomes more evident, the focus of management attention is inevitably moving to achieve a\nbalance between business as usual and business change. Projects are a means by which we introduce\nchange, and although many of the skills required are the same, there are some crucial differences\nbetween managing business as usual and managing project work.\nDefinition: Project\nA temporary organization that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business\nproducts according to an agreed business case.\nThere are five characteristics of a project that distinguish it from business as usual:\n● Change Projects are the means by which we introduce change.\n● Temporary Projects are temporary in nature. When the desired change has been implemented,\nbusiness as usual resumes (in its new form), and the need for the project is removed. As projects are\ntemporary, they should therefore have a defined start and a defined end.\n● Cross-functional A project involves a team of people with different skills working together on a\ntemporary basis to introduce a change that will impact others outside the team. Projects often work\nacross the usual functional divisions within an organization and sometimes span different\norganizations. This frequently causes stresses and strains both within and between organizations\n(for example, between customers and suppliers). Each has a different perspective and motivation for\ngetting involved in the project.\n5"

An organization may undertake many similar projects and establish\na familiar, proven pattern of project activity, but each one will differ in a certain way. This can mean a\ndifferent team, customer, supplier, product, location, or timeframe. All these factors combine to\nmake every project unique.\n● Uncertainty The characteristics already listed will introduce threats and opportunities over and\nabove those typically encountered within business as usual. Projects are riskier than any operational\naspects of an organization.\nProjects vary greatly. For example, an organization might undertake an IT project to improve the\nsystems required to manage its business. Another organization might undertake a clinical research\nproject to bring a new drug to market, and another organization might be building a new facility.\nFurthermore, the environment within which the project is being managed may influence how it is\nstarted, delivered, assured, and closed. There may be factors external to the project itself, such as\norganizational standards, the maturity of the organization, and regulatory frameworks and factors\nspecific to the individual project, such as the industry sector and the geographical locations. PRINCE2 is\ndesigned to work for all types of projects in any project environment.\n1.4 What is project management?\nDefinition: Project management\nProject management is the application of methods, tools, techniques, and competencies to\nenable the project to meet its objectives.\nThe five characteristics of a project (1.3) can result in some typical challenges such as:\n● ambiguity regarding who is responsible for what aspects of the project, leading to confusion and a\nlack of accountability\n● ambiguity or conflict regarding what the project will deliver, costs, and when\n● unrealistic expectations regarding what the project will deliver, costs, and when\n● unavailability of resources or reassigning resources to business as usual activities over project work\n● difficulty in estimating effort, durations, and costs for project work\n● uncontrolled change (sometimes referred to as scope creep)\n● difficulty keeping the project management team and stakeholders informed, engaged, and motivated\nduring the project lifecycle.\nThe purpose of project management is to address these challenges by reducing and managing\nambiguity. This is achieved by uniting the involved parties to clarify objectives and working practices.\nThe aim is to control the specialist work needed to create the products required of the project. Project\nmanagement involves the planning, delegating, monitoring, and control of all aspects of the project and\nthe motivation of those involved to achieve the project objectives within expected performance targets.\n6"

PRINCE2 includes performance targets for\nbenefits, cost, time, quality, scope, sustainability, and risk.\nPRINCE2 includes seven aspects of project performance to be managed. These are:\n● Benefits Those involved in the project need to be able to answer the question: why are we doing\nthis, and who are we doing it for? The project management team must have a clear understanding of\nthe purpose of the project and what needs to be achieved to justify its investment.\n● Costs As the project develops, there will be many factors that can affect the cost budget available or\nthat may lead to (potential) underspend or overspend against the cost budget. The project has to be\naffordable.\n● Time When will the project start, when will the key products be delivered, and when will the project\nfinish?\n● Quality Finishing on time and within budget is not much consolation if the result of the project is\nnot as specified or does not work. What is delivered by the project must be fit for purpose.\n● Scope What will the project deliver? There must be agreement on the project’s scope, otherwise the\nvarious parties involved may make different assumptions about what is included or excluded. The\nproject management team should not deliver beyond the scope, as this is a common source of\ndelays, overspend, and uncontrolled change (sometimes referred to as scope creep).\n● Sustainability All projects have an impact on their environment, and project management teams\nneed to know the sustainability performance targets for the project work and for the products\nrequired of the project.\n● Risk All projects involve risk. But exactly how much risk is the business prepared to take? Without a\nshared understanding of the business’ risk appetite, the project management team may be too\nrisk-averse or take more risks than the business is prepared to accept.\nPriorities can be established by agreeing on the project’s performance targets. For example, an urgent\nproject may place more importance on time than on other performance targets, such as costs. PRINCE2\nhelps with setting such priorities by allowing a range to be specified for each performance target in the\nform of tolerances (see section 2.4). Some performance targets may have a narrow tolerance, yet others\nmay have a broader tolerance. The agreement of performance targets and their tolerances is a\nprerequisite for exploring options and determining the project approach.\nAll seven project performance targets and their tolerances are used throughout the PRINCE2 method\nas the basis for control.\n1.5 The project context\nPRINCE2 has been designed so it can work within any context including organizational and commercial\ncontext, delivery method, sustainability requirements, and project scale. These common contexts are\ndescribed throughout this book to illustrate how PRINCE2 can be applied or tailored.\n7"

The organization delivering the\nproject (the supplier) will do so to satisfy a particular need identified by the business (the customer).\nThe business may divide the work into one or more elements, some of which may require suppliers to\ndeliver. Other elements may be delivered by the business itself, for example, an internal department\nsuch as IT or facilities. For a supplier, the work to be delivered could be the subject of a legally binding\ncontract, resulting from the procurement process. To deliver this work, the supplier might procure\nsubcontractors itself, further dividing its work into additional elements.\nIn a commercial environment, there may be hierarchies of commercial relationships between suppliers.\nRather than a simple customer-supplier relationship involving two organizations, projects might involve\nmultiple organizations covered by multiple contracts. There may be a single customer with a prime\ncontractor, or there may be several customers and several supplier organizations, each of which may\nhave its own business reasons for undertaking the project.\nThe contract between the parties describes how the customer(s) and supplier(s) will collaborate to\ndeliver the project.

The project may rely\non one or more delivery methods to create the required products. Typical delivery methods include:\n● Linear-sequential approach Each of the delivery steps to create the products occurs in sequence,\nand the product is made available during or at the end of the project (for example, in a construction\nproject where requirements gathering and design occur before construction starts).\n● Iterative-incremental approach This approach is often, but not exclusively, used for product\ndevelopment, where requirements gathering, design, development and/or coding, and testing occur\niteratively throughout the lifecycle of the project. This approach is often referred to as an agile\napproach.\n● Hybrid approach Some elements of the project use a linear-sequential approach, and other\nelements use an iterative-incremental approach. For example, a linear-sequential approach can be\nused for the development of the infrastructure for a service. Then, an iterative-incremental approach\ncan be used for the development of the customer service portal for users to access the service.\nPRINCE2 provides the controlled environment for specialist delivery methods. It does not assume or\nrequire any specific delivery method. Any approach can be used through the separation of the\nmanagement of the project and specialist work to produce the project products. Detailed and\ncomplementary guidance on working on iterative-incremental projects using PRINCE2 can be found in\nthe PRINCE2 Agile official book.\n1.5.4 Sustainability context\nThe business is likely to have sustainability objectives and commitments that the project needs to\nadhere or contribute to, which will inform the project’s objectives and how it is established and\nmanaged. PRINCE2, addresses sustainability requirements by including sustainability as one of the\nseven performance targets used to manage the project. Sustainability is also included in the method\nthrough the roles (sustainability responsibilities), documentation (such as plans and reports), practices\n(such as business case), and processes (such as activities to confirm sustainability requirements).\nIn everyday usage of the term, sustainability is often synonymous with the environment, but\nsustainability can mean different things to different organizations. For some, it may relate to the\nenvironmental impact of the project work, while for others it may relate to the whole life cost of the\nproducts delivered by the project and their resilience in operations. Some projects may have\nsustainability as their very purpose, such as the installation of solar panels.\nUnless otherwise specified, this book uses sustainability to mean one, some, or all of the 17 sustainable\ndevelopment goals defined by the United Nations.\n10"

What is considered a small project in a\nlarge multinational enterprise could be bigger than what is considered a large project in a small\norganization. It is usually more helpful to think of projects in terms of simple rather than small and\ncomplex rather than large. Generally, it is a case of how the business perceives the risk and the\nimportance of the project, relative to its business as usual operations.\nPRINCE2 can be tailored to the scale of the project via the:\n● governance arrangements between the business layer, the project board, the project manager, and\nthe teams\n● choice of which project roles are appointed to individuals from the user, business, and supplier\norganizations (for example, combining roles in simple projects and dividing roles in complex projects)\n● formality and level of detail of project documentation (in PRINCE2 these are referred to as\nmanagement products)\n● formality of the project controls (for example, frequency of reporting and reviewing)\n● selection and integration of the management approaches, such as a commercial management or\nchange management approach\n● number of stages and work packages the project is divided into\n● setting of the project performance targets and their tolerances.\n11"

By analysing the wants, needs,\ndesires, and frustrations of social media users, Data Knowledge can transform\nraw and unstructured data into reliable predictions that enable organizations\nto utilize consumer behaviours and insights.\nHowever, they have not been as effective in using data to their own advantage, now that the\ncompany has over 300 staff. In fact, the head of the data science division raised concerns in the\nlast senior leadership team meeting. The concerns were regarding the lack of visibility of who is\nworking on what projects, poor capacity planning, and claims of an overworked team with low\nmorale due to the constant juggling of commitments and firefighting issues.\nAs a way of addressing this, the data science division has been authorized to start a project to\ndevelop a time-recording solution and a set of reports on project and task assignments along\nwith resource utilization and capacity planning. The reports are expected to offer interactive and\nreal-time insights that can enable data-driven decisions around the utilization and planning of\nresources.\nData Knowledge has a defined framework for the management of projects. This is expected to be\na simple business change project, taking no more than three months in the current financial year\nto complete.\nSince Data Knowledge has in-house data analysis and app development capabilities as well as\nclear requirements for this project, the project will be led by the head of data science. They will\nwork with the development division in an iterative and incremental approach. This is to ensure\nthat the solution can be deployed quickly to several new projects and enhanced during its roll-out\nto the rest of the business.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n1\n-\nI\nn\nt\nr\no\nd\nu\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\nThe high-level project plan is as follows:\nStage 1 (initiation)\n● product backlog\n● minimum viable product definition\nStage 2\n● timebox 1\n● prototype of time-recording application\n● mock-up of resource management reports\n● timebox 2\n● first release of time-recording application and reports (must-have features)\n● pilot\n● timebox 3\n● enhancements following pilot\n● timebox 4\n● demonstration\n● roll-out\nScenario continues\n13"

The city council has been criticized for the\nlack of investment and modernization of the town centre.\nThey have recently decided to improve the vibrancy of the area and offer\nincreased opportunities for business by approving the funds for the ‘Louistown is Open for Business’\n(LOB) portfolio. This is an ambitious portfolio of projects covering the next five-year plan cycle.\nA new shopping centre, provisionally named ‘LouisShopping’, is seen as a key project within this\nportfolio. This is a complex infrastructure project due to the:\n● location of the building and historical nature of the surrounding buildings\n● requirement for the design to be consistent with the environment while offering modern\nfacilities supported by the latest technology\n● need to include underground parking space\n● importance of minimizing disruption to residents and businesses during the construction works\n● recent award of ‘green town’ status to Louistown, and the sustainability requirements this will\nimpose on the development.\nDue to the nature of the work, in which just the construction element is likely to span over two\nfinancial years, the council has approved the strategic business case, the initial high-level project\nplan and has appointed BuildyBrick as the main contractor. They have established a requirement\nfor a traditional delivery method in line with their standard approach to projects. The general\nview is that this project is long overdue, and the council would like ‘LouisShopping’ to be open to\nthe public by the end of financial year three.\nThe project has just completed the initiation stage and commenced the first delivery stage\n(stage 2).

The company experienced substantial growth in the\nfirst few years, transforming from a niche small-medium-enterprise (SME) to\none of the leading fintech firms in the field of financial fraud, working with the\nworld’s largest banks and merchants. In the last 18 months, Findef’s growth has stagnated. This\nfactor, coupled with the arrival of new competitors, is creating discomfort among some investors.\nIn response, the leadership board recently approved the development of a suite of three\ninnovative cybersecurity products that will transform the market in financial risk management.\nAdditionally, the leadership board agreed that Findef will change its commercial and operating\nmodels to exploit the new products to their full potential. The company will now deal directly with\nthe end user rather than through banks and merchants.\nThe FindefTwo programme has been established to oversee both the business transformation\nand the development of the new products. As the programme requires fresh investment, the\nboard has established an investment committee that funds and oversees the programme.\nThe project for the product development will use a hybrid approach of linear-sequential for the\noverarching design and deployment of the product set and iterative-incremental for the\ndevelopment of each product. The project also includes upskilling Findef’s DevOps team in a new\ndevelopment platform. To mitigate some risks, the project includes procuring advisors and a\nmarketing agency that could validate assumptions and share their product experience with the\ncompany.\nThe project is at the beginning of stage 3. The high-level project plan for the product\ndevelopment project is as follows:\nStage 1 (initiation)\n● business case, project initiation documentation\nStage 2 (high-level design)\n● request for proposals (advisor, marketing agency, training), contract awards\n● product design (product family architecture)\nStage 3 (detailed design)\n● product design: product 1\n● early market testing\n● DevOps upskilling\nStage 4 (MVP product 1)\n● iterative-incremental development and soft launch of product 1 to minimum viable product\n(MVP)\n● product design: product 2, product design: product 3\n16"

Moreover, it can be used for all\ntypes of organizations, whether commercial, governmental, non-profit, or not-for-profit.

Rather than prescribing what to do to align the method to the specific\nproject, PRINCE2 offers guidance through principles. These principles enable the project management\nteam to decide how PRINCE2 will be used on their project.\nThe seven PRINCE2 principles are:\n● ensure continued business justification\n● learn from experience\n● define roles, responsibilities, and relationships\n● manage by stages\n● manage by exception\n● focus on products\n● tailor to suit the project.\nHow the method is applied and tailored depends on the nature of the project and factors internal and\nexternal to the business as shown in figure 2.1.\n20"

If it does not, it should be\nstopped.\nThere must be a justifiable reason for starting a project, and the justification must remain valid and be\nrevalidated throughout the lifecycle of the project. The business justification drives decision-making to\nensure the project remains aligned with the benefits sought and contributes to business objectives.\nOrganizations that lack rigour in business justification may find that projects proceed even when there\nare few real benefits or when a project has only tentative associations with the business strategy. Poor\nalignment with business strategy can also result in organizations having a portfolio of projects that have\ninconsistent or duplicated objectives.\n21"

All parties involved in the project will\nneed a balance between expected benefits, costs, and risks for them to have business justification for\ntheir involvement.\nThe business justification for a project may change; therefore, it is important that what the project is\ndelivering remains consistent with the evolving justification. If continuing with the project can no longer\nbe justified, then it should be stopped and end in a controlled way. Cancelling a project in these\ncircumstances is a positive contribution to the business as the project’s funds and resources can be\nreinvested in other more worthwhile projects.\nAfter the project is completed, the project should be reviewed to evaluate if the benefits have\nmaterialized sufficiently to warrant the final investment and what lessons can be learned from the\nproject.\nBelow are some examples of the application of the ‘ensure business justification’ principle.\nFor a commercial project with one or more customers and suppliers, each party will need to have a\nclear business justification to undertake the project and to continue with it. The customer may want to\nenhance market share by introducing a new product. The supplier’s business justification might include\nnon-financial benefits, such as gaining an impressive customer reference for promotional purposes or\nbuilding experience in applying new technologies.\nFor a co-owned project, such as a governmental project to jointly develop a new IT system across a\nnumber of agencies, if the business justification is lost for one or more parties, those parties should\nconsider ending their participation in the project. In this case, the consequences of ending or\nwithdrawing participation in the project, such as contractual obligations, will inform the decision and\nany approach to prematurely close the project. Throughout the project, each investing party will need\nto keep monitoring their own business justification to ensure that the project is still worthwhile for\nthem.\n2.2 Learn from experience\nKey message\nA PRINCE2 project team actively seeks, records, and implements improvements as a result of\nrelevant lessons learned from prior projects and throughout the life of the project. It applies\nthem in future projects and shares them for others to apply.\nA common characteristic of projects is that they include an element of uniqueness. This makes projects\nchallenging as the temporary team may not have experience of a project quite like the one being\nundertaken.\nTo overcome these challenges, project teams need to find ways to learn from the experience of others\nand from the experience gained from the project as it develops.\n22"

If the project is a ‘first’ for the people within the business or if there is any content which is\nnew or novel, then it is even more important to learn from others. This could include projects\ndelivered by people or organizations external to the business to identify relevant lessons.\n● As the project progresses The project team should continue to learn. Lessons should be included\nin relevant reports and reviews and included at the end of each stage. The goal is to seek\nopportunities to implement improvements during the life of the project. The retrospective technique\nis an example of gathering lessons in agile approach.\n● As the project closes The project team should share the insights gained during the project.\nThe foundation for learning is data and the ability to gain insights from it. Projects should be clear about\nwhat data is required, how it will be analysed so that insights can be gained and applied, and what will\nhappen to the data during the project and when the project closes.\nProject teams need to consider how to effectively share lessons with all those involved in the project, as\npeople may have different learning needs and preferences. Some may learn best by observing, whereas\nothers do so by experimenting.\nIt is important to learn from both mistakes and successes to continuously improve and innovate. It is\nthe responsibility of everyone involved with the project to identify lessons rather than wait for someone\nelse to do so. Lessons that are not used to improve the project, or future projects, are only ‘lessons\nidentified’ and not actually ‘lessons learned’.\nBelow are some examples of applying the ‘learn from experience’ principle.\nIn a smaller project with one co-located team, ‘lessons learned’ can be discussed on a regular basis in\nteam meetings. Learning in this case happens on the job, potentially on a daily basis.\nIn a large and complex project, the learning process will involve many project team members who could\nbe spread across multiple teams and locations. This large-scale approach will make it harder to ensure\neveryone has access to the same learning experience.\nLearning in larger projects may require more advanced communication, such as explanatory videos,\npresentation kits for project team managers, or tailored workshops in subgroups. Such projects may\nbenefit from field trips, pilots, simulations, or go-live rehearsals as a source of learning too.\n23"

Moreover, a\nPRINCE2 project management team initiates and builds relationships with and between\ninternal and external stakeholders.\nProjects need people. It is important that the right people are involved, and they know what is expected\nof them and what they may expect from others in the project. Successful projects require an\nunderstanding of the relationships with and between stakeholders and ongoing activities to strengthen\nthem. This is why ‘People’ is one of the five integrated elements of PRINCE2.\nStakeholders can be individuals or groups within or external to the business. Stakeholders within the\nbusiness could be a work council, sustainability board, diversity board, owners, department leaders, or\nother project teams; stakeholders outside the business could be trade unions, customers, suppliers,\ncommunities, interest groups, banks, or the media.\nAll projects have the following primary stakeholders: the business, users, and suppliers (see section\n1.5.1). All three stakeholder interests need to be represented effectively in the project management\nteam; this is reflected in the design of a PRINCE2 project board (see section 6.2.1).\nDefining roles and responsibilities is particularly challenging as projects are cross-functional, may\ninvolve more than one organization, often have a mix of full and part-time resources, and may be\nspread across multiple locations. The management structures of the parties involved in the project are\nlikely to be varied, with different priorities, objectives, and interests to protect. The day-to-day line\nmanagement structures of the business may not be designed for, or suited to, project work.\nThe assignment of roles to individuals throughout the life of the project and their responsibilities must\nbe clear, unambiguous, and accepted. To be successful, projects must have an explicit project\nmanagement team structure consisting of defined and agreed roles and responsibilities for the people\ninvolved in the project. Moreover, the projects must have an understanding of the relationships and a\nmeans for effective communication between them.\nThe goal is to clearly articulate roles and responsibilities to provide a clear, coherent structure that all\nstakeholders understand and is suitable to enable effective project delivery performance against the\nproject performance targets.\nBelow are some examples of applying the ‘define roles, responsibilities, and relationships’ principle.\nIf the project is part of a programme, then some of the project responsibilities may be held by people in\nthe programme management team. In this case, the programme’s business change manager (BCM) may\nundertake the project executive or senior user role on the project board to help align the project with\nthe programme. The programme management office (PMO) could provide project support, or the\nprogramme’s design authority could be given decision-making responsibility for authorizing changes at\nthe project level. Agreements need to be made about who accepts which project role and the authority\n24"

The goal is to enhance consistency and coherence between the\nproject and the programme.\nThe nature of the project will determine the number of stakeholders and the amount of change it\ncreates for each of them. A project with a small number of stakeholders and a high degree of impact will\nhave a very focused approach to engaging with them, perhaps on an individual and personal basis. A\nproject with a large number of stakeholders and a wide range of impacts may have to use multiple\napproaches with a mix of personalized engagement and more general engagement through surveys\nand broadcast channels (such as emails).\nFor projects that have development teams using agile development methods, the PRINCE2 team\nmanager role may be held collectively by the development team.\n2.4 Manage by exception\nKey message\nA PRINCE2 project establishes limits of delegated authority by defining tolerances for\nperformance against its plans.\nDefinition: Tolerance\nThe permissible deviation above and below the plan’s target for benefits, cost, time, quality,\nscope, sustainability, and risk without needing to escalate the deviation to the next level of\nmanagement. Tolerance is applied at project, stage, and team levels.\nPRINCE2 enables appropriate governance by defining distinct responsibilities for directing, managing,\nand delivering the project and clearly defining accountability at each level.\nAccountability is established by:\n● delegating authority from one management level to the next by setting tolerances against the seven\naspects of performance (benefits, cost, time, quality, scope, sustainability, and risk) for the respective\nlevel (project, stage, team)\n● establishing controls so if tolerances are forecast to be exceeded, they are flagged as being an\nexception and immediately escalated to the next management level for a decision on how to proceed\n● establishing an assurance mechanism so that each management level can be confident that the\nexception controls are effective.\n25"

This ensures that decisions are\nmade at the right level in the organization. The goal is to alert the next management level in the project\nas early as possible that the work will move outside of agreed tolerances, and a decision is needed on if\nand how to proceed. The decision-maker can decide to accept the deviation and its consequences or\nact to remove or reduce it.\nA project using an iterative-incremental delivery method with defined timeboxes will typically fix time\nand cost and vary in scope. In this case, time and cost will have much tighter tolerances set than the\nscope.\nAn example of applying the ‘manage by exception’ principle is that the use of tolerances will differ\ndepending on the project’s context, such as a project with a commercial arrangement between\ncustomer and supplier where the tolerances will be reflected in the contract. In this example, if the\nproject manager learns that procured materials will be delivered late and the issue cannot be resolved\nwithin the tolerances, the project manager will need to alert the project board quickly. The contract may\ndefine any cost remedies available between the customer and supplier, but there may be consequences\nfor the project’s stakeholders caused by the delay. In this case, the project board will need to decide\nwhat actions to take and provide direction to the project manager. By reviewing the tolerances at the\nend of every stage, the project is able to adapt and modify the next stage activities to reflect a changing\noperating environment.\n26"

Many projects benefit from having more than two stages.\nAdvantages of managing by stages are:\n● It enables adaptability to changes in the project or business context.\n● It provides review and decision points, giving the project board opportunities to assess the project’s\nviability at defined intervals rather than let it continue in an uncontrolled manner.\n● It provides the ability to ensure that key decisions are made prior to the detailed work needed to\nimplement them.\n● It allows clarification of what the impact will be of an identified external influence, such as the\norganizational budget setting process or the finalizing of legislation.\n● It facilitates the principle of manage by exception by delegating authority to the project manager at\neach stage.\nThe choice of appropriate stages for a project will depend on a number of factors (see 7.2.3), including:\n● minimizing risk exposure through the project lifecycle\n● the size and complexity of the project (shorter stages offer more control, whereas longer stages\nreduce the effort for senior management)\n● any significant decisions and control points required during the project’s lifecycle; these will often be\nlinked to key investment, business, or technical decisions\n● sector or business policies and standards.\nThe project board authorizes one stage of the project at a time and delegates the authority for day-to-\nday control of the stage, within agreed tolerances, to the project manager. As long as the stage is\nforecast to remain within tolerance, the project manager is authorized to make adjustments as required.\nThe project board only authorizes the next stage if there is sufficient business justification and funds to\n27"

If the project no longer has a valid business case, the project board will determine whether\nand how to recover the project or prematurely end it.\nAn example of applying the ‘manage by stages’ principle is when teams work in ‘sprints’ or ‘timeboxes’\nwhile operating incrementally and iteratively to realize the agreed features and user stories. PRINCE2\ncan be tailored to work with sprints and user stories instead of work packages and product\ndescriptions. The project manager will define how many sprints are required for each stage. In this way,\nthe project is consistent with the principle of manage by stages.\n2.6 Focus on products\nKey message\nA PRINCE2 project focuses on the definition and delivery of products, in particular their user\nquality expectations and requirements.\nDefinition: Product\nAn input or output, whether tangible or intangible, that can be described in advance, created,\nand tested. PRINCE2 includes four types of products:\n● Management products Are often documents or information needed to support the\nmanagement of the project, such as a business case or a plan.\n● Specialist products Are the products that are needed by the user to realize the benefits\nrequired of the project.\n● The project product Describes the total output from the project as defined in the project\nproduct description (see section 7.3.2.1).\n● External products Are products developed or provided outside of the project’s control but\nwhich the project is dependent on, for example, the publication of a new standard.\nSpecialist products will be referred to throughout the book as simply ‘products’, except when\na distinction is needed between management and specialist products.\nThe term ‘project products’ refers to the specialist and management products created during\nthe project.\nProjects that focus on what the project needs to produce are more likely to be efficient and avoid waste\nthan projects that focus primarily on the work activity. This is because the purpose of a project is to\nfulfil stakeholder expectations in accordance with the business justification. Therefore, there must be a\ncommon understanding of the products required and the user quality expectations for them.\nThe purpose of a project can be interpreted in many different ways, unless there is an explicit\nunderstanding of the products to be produced and the criteria against which they will be individually\n28"

PRINCE2 requires projects to be output-oriented rather than work-oriented. PRINCE2 calls\nthese outputs ‘products’.\nThis focus on products:\n● ensures that the project only performs work that directly contributes to the delivery of a product\n(that is, the project does no more work than it needs to deliver its agreed products)\n● helps manage uncontrolled change (‘scope creep’) by ensuring that all changes are agreed in terms\nof how they will impact the project products and the business case for the project\n● reduces the risk of user dissatisfaction and acceptance disputes by agreeing (at the start of the\nproject) what will be produced by the project\n● assists a pause or closure of the project. Agreement can be more easily met to pause or close a\nproject after certain products are completed. It also allows easier and controlled resumption of the\nproject.\nAn output-oriented project is one that agrees and defines the project product prior to undertaking the\nactivities required to produce it. The set of agreed products defines the scope of a project and provides\nthe basis for planning and control.\nA PRINCE2 project uses product descriptions that provide the means to determine effort estimates,\nresource requirements, dependencies, and activity schedules. The focus on products supports almost\nevery aspect of PRINCE2: planning, responsibilities, progress reporting, quality, change control,\nacceptance, and risk management.\nBelow are examples of applying the ‘focus on products’ principle.\nIn a small simple project, such as publishing a new management book, a single project product\ndescription might suffice. This description will determine, among others features, how many chapters\nwill be required, the desired total number of pages, the language, and the number of graphics in colour\nversus black and white. Product descriptions for projects using an iterative-incremental delivery\nmethod, such as agile, may be in the form of requirements, features, epics, and user stories.\nFor larger and more complex projects, the project product description will be divided into sub-products\nand then further subdivided to a level of detail to understand how each product will be sourced,\ndeveloped, and approved. The further the products are subdivided, the harder it will be for the project\nboard to be able to decide whether product descriptions are correct. This is because the content\nbecomes more technical and will require specialist knowledge to understand. In this case, it is important\nthat the supplier has the expertise to define the right products at each level, and the business establishes\nproject assurance with the knowledge necessary to assure that the product meets the specification.\n2.7 Tailor to suit the project\nKey message\nPRINCE2 is applied and tailored to suit the project environment, size, complexity, importance,\ndelivery method, team capability, and level of risk.\n29"

Furthermore, it can be used for any project type, geography, or culture.\nIt can be used on any project because the method is designed to be applied and tailored to suit each\nproject’s specific needs and context.\nThe purpose of tailoring is to ensure that:\n● the project management method used is appropriate to the project (for example, aligning the\nmethod with the business processes that may govern and support the project, such as human\nresources, finance, and procurement)\n● project controls are appropriate to the project’s scale, complexity, importance, delivery method,\nteam capability, and risk (for example, the frequency and formality of reports and reviews).\nTailoring requires the project board and the project manager to make proactive choices and decisions\non how PRINCE2 will be applied. It may also involve adjusting the terminology to match terms used by\nthe organizations involved or replacing some of the PRINCE2 techniques (such as the risk management\ntechnique) with alternative procedures such as those already used by the business or supplier(s).\nWhen tailoring PRINCE2, it is important to remember that effective project management requires\ninformation (but not necessarily documents) and decisions (but not necessarily meetings).\nIf PRINCE2 is not tailored, it is unlikely that the project management effort and management approaches\nwould be appropriate for the needs of the project. This can lead to inattentive project management at\none extreme, where PRINCE2 is followed without question, or ‘heroic’ project management at the other\nextreme, where PRINCE2 is not really followed at all.\nThe project manager is responsible for tailoring and will make recommendations having consulted\nrelevant lessons and standards. The project board is accountable and needs to approve the\nrecommendations at the end of the initiation stage and every time there is a proposed change to the\nmanagement approaches.\nHow PRINCE2 will be applied and tailored for the particular project is captured in the project initiation\ndocumentation. This ensures that all those involved in the project understand how PRINCE2 is to be\nused and how to carry out their responsibilities. Care should be taken that the proposed tailoring is\nconsistent with PRINCE2’s seven principles and that the resultant method retains its integrity.\nAn example of applying the ‘tailor to the suit the project’ principle is where the project has a commercial\ncustomer-supplier relationship. The project may need to align the project management processes,\npractices, and documentation to two or more quality systems, one from the customer and one from the\nsupplier. For example, a supplier may wish to use their in-house product development framework based\non an iterative-incremental delivery method using agile management approaches. To avoid potential\nconfusion, the project manager might propose to:\n● map and define terminology between PRINCE2 and the supplier’s agile management approaches\n● add the project team roles of ‘customer subject matter expert’ and ‘supplier subject matter expert’\nto the agile team, representing the customer and the supplier respectively\n● add a coach to guide the teams in working effectively in the combination of PRINCE2 and the\nsupplier’s in-house agile method\n● collaborate and communicate according to agile ways of working, such as a daily stand-up and\nsupport agile reporting tools, such as information radiators\n● define project procedures, such as working with sprints or work packages, product descriptions, or\nuser stories, and how to use these in the project.\n30"

They often have a role to play,\nfor example directly contributing to the project through activities such as defining, assuring, and\naccepting products into the business. They may indirectly contribute by undertaking activities within\ntheir area of the business to accommodate or derive benefit from the project, such as upskilling staff,\nchanging ways of working, or integrating new products into their area of the organization.\nWhen these activities are outside of the defined project scope, it is important to ensure that there is a\nclear understanding of the dependencies on such activities, who is responsible for undertaking them,\nand how they will be funded and monitored. If this type of work is not managed carefully, projects can\nbe delayed or fail to achieve their benefits.\nLeading people beyond a project’s direct authority (often across organizational boundaries) requires a\ndegree of cultural intelligence. Cultural intelligence is the capability to relate and work across cultures\nwithin the organizational ecosystem. Successfully working across cultures requires:\n● teams to adapt and find ways to successfully interface with each other\n● setting clear project boundaries within which people can flex\n● establishing the right conditions for people to succeed\n● awareness of and means to consider the many different perspectives that may exist in the project\n(such awareness is often referred to as emotional intelligence)\n● awareness of the constraints people work within, including different pulls on their time and attention.\n3.3.2 Building effective teams\nAn effective team will require a diverse set of capabilities, competencies, and perspectives that match\nthe requirements of the project.\nIdeally, organizations would select the people needed to fulfil each of the required roles, but this is\noften not possible. It is important to understand the competencies and capabilities of the people\nrecruited or assigned to a project, and ensure any gaps are identified and mitigations established to\ncover them, such as upskilling or shifting responsibilities for certain tasks to more appropriate people.\nEven when people technically have the same capabilities and competencies, they are likely to perform\nthe same role differently. Sometimes, the same person may perform differently depending on who they\nare working with.\nAs temporary organizations, project teams may not have worked together before and may need to\nquickly discover how to work together effectively. It can help accelerate team building by using\nstructured exercises that focus on building not only self-awareness and self-management but also an\nunderstanding of other’s perspectives. This can build trust and find compatible ways of working.\nRoles and responsibilities should reflect the capability, authority, and availability of the individual\nundertaking the work and should be considered through the lens of their key relationships. They should\nbe reviewed in the event of any shifts in these key relationships and updated accordingly.\n40"

Team members may also need space to\nexperiment, inspect, adapt, self-organize, and adjust their ways of working.\nPRINCE2 supports building effective teams through the:\n● Project plan This explains the team’s goals to create a clear sense of purpose and provides an\nability to answer questions from stakeholders.\n● Project management team structure and the role descriptions These explain the structure of\nthe team and their associated roles, responsibilities, and relationships to support developing key\nrelationships and identifying any coaching or training needs (such as influencing skills and how to\nhandle resistance to the change).\n● Communication management approach This explains how team members will actively engage\nwith and support each other and how relationships will be developed between different groups\nwithin the wider project ecosystem.\n● Project initiation documentation This explains the agreed ways of working, empowering the team\nto remain focused on delivering the project outcomes.\n● Product based planning This approach places great emphasis on getting agreement on what will\nmeet user needs (product description) and also clarifying the dependencies and sequencing of key\noutputs (products).\n3.3.3 Bringing the team together\nWhether projects are delivered virtually, in person, or through a hybrid approach, the way in which\npeople work with each other needs to be carefully considered, both to optimize the use of people’s time\nand to build social cohesion. Social cohesion is developed by:\n● people meeting in a purposeful way on a regular basis and building trust across organizational or\nproject silos\n● considering how key relationships will be developed and maintained over the length of the project to\nbuild resilience for when inevitable hurdles are encountered\n● considering the benefits of co-locating an office-based project team to facilitate the organic\nrelationship building that occurs during non-structured activities (such as conversations over the desk\npartition, in the communal kitchen, in corridors between meetings, shared lunches, and social events).\nWhen teams are virtual, located at a distance from each other, or hybrid, building social cohesion may\nneed additional activities such as:\n● syncing co-location days for key people and teams with a focus on building key relationships\n● allowing time for less structured conversations online\n● holding ‘away days’ for virtual teams\n● using virtual collaboration tools to enhance effectiveness and efficiency of virtual ways of working\n● providing opportunities or incentives for people to meet and socialize face-to-face.\n41"

This is a full day of team building activities\nthat offer an opportunity to share lessons, re-energize for the upcoming stage, and build social\ncohesion within the team.\nTo ensure that the unity of the team is not lost after the ‘pause and reflect’ day, certain changes\nhave been agreed.

The focus is on:\n● providing information in multiple formats which can be easily shared through these networks\n● monitoring whether information is flowing freely throughout the project ecosystem\n● identifying any team members or groups who are disconnected and working to reconnect them.\n● Remote teams A more deliberate and structured approach is required to ensure information is\nflowing through the project ecosystem. The focus is on:\n● building in time to allow for unstructured listening and sharing of information\n● seeking clarity on how information is flowing through the project ecosystem and providing\ninformation in appropriate formats to facilitate this\n● identifying key relationships and agreeing how they will build both structured and unstructured\ntime together.\n● Hybrid teams Hybrid teams’ means of communication must ensure the project does not develop\nseparate groups who are more involved or less involved because of their location.\n43"

They agreed to meet for a coffee every two weeks for a general catch-up\nin a local park, as they usually met virtually. The company provided coffee vouchers at a central\ncoffee shop, encouraging people to accompany each other for coffee whenever they are in town.\nOn one occasion, the data science team leader was unsure of the level of detail to be captured in\nthe solution and related reports. Specifically, they had to decide if it would be sufficient to record\nhow many hours per project each resource carries out, or if it would also be useful to have that\ninformation at the task-level.\nOn one hand, reporting at the task level would give assurance to project managers that the team\nis allocating their time to priority tasks; on the other hand, reporting at this low level would be a\nsignificant cultural change and the staff could be uncomfortable with such level of scrutiny.\nThe two team leaders exchanged ideas over coffee and agreed that reporting at the task-level\nwould be too much.

This ensures people factors are continually addressed throughout\nthe project’s lifecycle.\nPeople factors permeate the other principles as illustrated below.\nEnsure continued business justification\n● Organizations are fundamentally a collection of people interacting with each other around the core\npurposes of that organization. The business justification for a project needs to satisfy all three\nproject interests: user, business, and supplier. Defining a project that aligns all of these interests can\ntake time and effort. Therefore, it is important to consider the dynamics of the key relationships\nrelating to these interests, as they impact how agreement is reached and determine whether the\nproject continues to be valid. Moreover, it is crucial to recognize that what is considered justification\nmay change when roles change.\n● Business justification can be perception-based, so the communication management approach is a\nkey enabler to ensure ongoing perceived business justification by managing key relationships and\nshowcasing progress to demonstrate value.\nLearn from experience\n● There is significant value in learning from visible knowledge, such as business books and captured\nlearning, but there is valuable knowledge hidden within a project ecosystem. This requires a\ncollaborative environment that encourages knowledge sharing throughout the lifetime of a project.\nKnowledge sharing enables people to benefit from each other’s experience.\n● In particular, people factors such as behaviours, culture, and relationships are difficult to document\nand are best learned through social learning. For example, team members connecting and learning\nfrom people who have worked on an earlier stage or other projects with similar characteristics.\nManage by stages\n● The stages of a project often mark a change in the influencers and any key relationships. They are\ngood points to review how the project is planned to deliver, ensuring it remains aligned with how\npeople interact with each other and the wider organizational ecosystem. Stage boundaries often\nmark a transition in the organizational design (see Chapter 6).\n● Stage boundaries provide a more controlled way to review the skills needed for the next delivery\nstages and make changes, even to the Project Board. It is better to have the right people managing\nthe project rather than people who are unable to effectively contribute.\nManage by exception\n● Decisions should be made at the most local level where the knowledge needed to make and own\nthose decisions resides. Decisions should be progressed through the levels when a decision has the\npotential to impact other areas of the project. Therefore, it requires different perspectives to be\nconsidered, or it will have a wider impact outside of the project boundaries.\n● The extent of delegation is often dependent on the level of confidence and trust that exists in the\nkey relationships and will adapt over the life of a project in response to the skills and capabilities of\nindividuals. Improving confidence and trust improves the ability to manage by exception.\n46"

They are a fast\nlearner who has demonstrated awareness of project management. Therefore, the contracted\nproject manager is managing by exception, asking for decisions to be made without much\nsupervision and to be notified of any deviations against tolerances.\nBy contrast, the campaign team manager is a specialist in campaigns but lacks planning and\ncoordination skills. The contracted project manager has decided that a closer management style\nis needed, and the delegation level will be based on direct instructions, coaching and slowly\ngranting more autonomy in the completion of project tasks.\n3.5.2 People and PRINCE2 practices\nPRINCE2 defines seven practices (see Chapter 4) that are essential aspects of project management that\nmust be applied continually and in parallel throughout the life of the project. The ‘organizing’ practice\nexplains how people organize within a temporary project management team. In this way, it ensures that\nthe interests of the user, supplier, and business are represented in the project and establishes the\ndesign and development of the project organization.\nPeople factors are represented in all the practices. For example, the development of the business case\nrequires multi-layered perspectives from across the organizational ecosystem (business, user, and\nsupplier communities). This is to provide clarity regarding the project’s purpose and enable a common\nunderstanding to develop across the project team.\n47"

The strength of PRINCE2 is the way in which the seven practices are integrated, both in how\nthey link together and are used across all the PRINCE2 processes.\nThe PRINCE2 processes (see Chapters 12 to 19) address the progressive flow of the project (the\nlifecycle), describing actions relating to each of the practices when they are needed.

This will include the way the PRINCE2 practices are applied. This may range from the\nbusiness providing standards or prescriptive guidelines to allowing the project management team a\nlarge degree of freedom as to how they apply each practice to the project.\nThe PRINCE2 practices are designed to help the project management team apply and tailor the method,\nprincipally through a suite of management approaches (such as the benefits management approach).\nEach management approach defines the procedures, techniques, and standards to be applied and the\nresponsibilities for that aspect of project management to be effective.\nPRINCE2 does not prescribe how procedures, techniques, and standards should be documented, the\nlevel of detail required, or how they are published and shared. The level of detail could vary from a few\nparagraphs to a comprehensive instruction manual. The level and type of documentation is established\nby the Project Board who will consider what they need to manage and document their decisions within\nagreed business policies.\nContextual factors such as importance, risk, and urgency of the project will influence the level of control\nrequired, which will determine the degree of formality and frequency of monitoring, reviewing,\nreporting, and decision-making. The organizations involved and the relationship between them (for\nexample, customer and supplier) will also influence the controls that will be established. Whether the\nproject is part of a wider programme or portfolio will influence how the project management team\ninteracts with the business and incorporates their management requirements. When applying the\nPRINCE2 practices, project management teams should also reflect any tailoring of the roles, processes,\nand terminology.\n51\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n4\n-\nI\nn\nt\nr\no\nd\nu\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\nt\no\nP\nR\nN\nC\nE\n2\nP\nr\na\nc\nt\ni\nc\ne\ns\nI"

These measurable improvements are called benefits. In cases of compliance or regulatory\nprojects, the benefits may be compared to the consequences of inaction.\nPRINCE2 projects deliver outputs in the form of products which are used to facilitate changes in an\norganization or for organizations. These changes create capabilities that lead to outcomes. The\noutcomes allow the organization(s) to realize the benefits that are explained in the business case for the\nproject. Outcomes that are perceived as negative by one or more stakeholders are called dis-benefits.\nOutputs\nCapabilities\nDeliver\nDis-beneﬁts\nMeasured by\nBeneﬁts\nOutcomes\nEmbed\nLead to\nBusiness\nobjectives\nFigure 5.1 Relationship between outputs, outcomes, and benefits\n56"

In PRINCE2, outputs are the\nspecialist products that will be used to enable change.\nCapability The completed set of project outputs required to deliver an outcome.\nOutcome The result of change, normally affecting real-world behaviour and circumstances.\nChanges are implemented to achieve outcomes, which are achieved as a result of the\nactivities undertaken to facilitate the change.\nBenefit The measurable improvement resulting from an outcome that is perceived as an\nadvantage by the investing organization and contributes towards one or more business\nobjectives.\nDis-benefit The measurable decline resulting from an outcome perceived as negative by the\ninvesting organization and which detracts from one or more business objectives.\nBusiness objective The measurable outcomes that demonstrate progress in relation to the\norganization’s strategy and to which the project should contribute.\nAll projects must have a business justification, usually documented in a business case. The business\ncase establishes not only the reason for the project but also confirms whether the project is:\n● desirable (the balance of costs, benefits, and risks)\n● viable (able to deliver the products)\n● achievable (whether use of the products is likely to result in envisaged outcomes and resulting benefits).\nBusiness justification is not only about costs but also about understanding the value of a project. It is the\nperceived benefits or importance of the outcomes in proportion to the resources deployed to achieve\nthem. Moreover, business justification is about selecting an approach that offers the best overall value.\nIt is a PRINCE2 principle that a project must ensure continued business justification. This requires that\nthe business justification is established at the beginning of the project through the creation of a\nbusiness case and then kept under regular review and updated in response to the decisions and events\nthat might impact the desirability, viability, or achievability of the project. If the business justification\nceases to be valid, the project should be stopped or changed.\nScenario: desirable, viable, but not achievable\nUpon review of the outputs of stage 2 in the campaign project by NowByou\n(which included the campaign’s high-level requirements gathering and options\nanalysis) and in preparation for stage 3, the project manager met with the\nproject board. This was to examine the project business case, as more\ninformation is now available.\nThe group concluded that the approach outlined can be delivered on time and is affordable.\nHowever, the (quality of the) communication vehicles proposed is deemed unlikely to reach the\nintended audience. For that reason, the project board has asked the project sponsor to redefine\nthe project scope.\n57\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n5\n-\nB\nu\ns\nn\ne\ns\ns\ni\nc\na\ns\ne"

It needs to include sufficient information to enable the project board to confirm\nthe business justification and authorize the project manager to initiate the project. PRINCE2 uses the\nterm ‘outline business case’ for this initial justification. Other approaches may use terms such as\n‘strategic outline case’. The outline business case is documented in the project brief.\nIn most cases, the project costs, timescales, products, risks, and targets will not be sufficiently\nunderstood at this point to provide a robust justification of the entire project. Therefore, the outline\nbusiness case will need further development and refinement. As the project is planned in more detail\nand information becomes clearer, the outline business case is developed into a more detailed business\ncase. PRINCE2 uses the term ‘full business case’ to describe this enhanced business case. Other\napproaches may also use the terms ‘detailed business case’ or ‘final business case’.\nThe evolution from the project mandate to the project brief and the (full) business case is shown in\nfigure 5.2.\nProject\nmandate\nIs provided by the business and\nsets expectations and constraints\nProject brief\nContains the outline business\ncase in response to the mandate\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n5\n-\nB\nu\ns\nn\ne\ns\ns\ni\nc\na\ns\ne\nBusiness case\nProvides the full business case\nin response to the project brief\nFigure 5.2 Evolution of the business case\nThe business case may also undergo further refinement as the project progresses across stages as\nactual costs are incurred, forecast benefits are potentially achieved, and information is further\nunderstood.\n58"

The\nearly adopters’ feedback will help Findef identify bugs and design flaws in the\nproduct, as well as indicate any potential marketing opportunities.\nThe project sponsor is aware that incorporating market feedback into the product decisions will\nenable rapid adoption when the minimum viable product is launched. However, this approach is\nnot overly predictive of what can be expected as an acceptable list of features. This means that\nthe original cost estimates presented in the business case are far from what would be needed to\nrespond to the market’s feedback. As a consequence, the project board now needs to return to\nthe investment committee to request additional funding for the project.\n5.2.2\nAligning products to business objectives and\ntolerances\nThe theory of the links between outputs, outcomes, and benefits is straightforward. However, putting\ntheory into practice is often much more difficult. Many organizations will be able to identify projects\nthat have produced products that were never fully used or organizational changes that were never fully\nembedded. For benefits to be realized, the outcomes must be achieved, which means that the outputs\nfrom the project are used as intended, new capability is defined, and barriers to the use of the new\ncapability are identified.\nA problem that commonly occurs is that projects are often successful from a delivery perspective but\nfail from an investment perspective. As the project’s outcomes and benefits are often only realized after\nthe project has closed, it is easy for project teams to become focused solely on creating products (the\noutputs). The link from the project’s outputs to outcomes and benefits needs to be clearly identified\nand made visible to those involved in the project. Otherwise, there is a danger that the original purpose\nof the project can get lost, and the benefits will not be realized. Some products are enablers for other\nproducts to generate benefits.\nUltimately, the outcomes and benefits to be achieved from the project need to align with and contribute\nto the business objectives. These may include environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals set by\nthe organization. The sustainability performance targets and tolerances for the project, documented in\nthe business case, should reference and contribute to the ESG goals of the organization (see section\n5.4.4 for more information on sustainability).\nThe benefits management approach that supports the business case includes the amount and timing of\nbenefits forecast to be achieved by the project and additional guidance relating to the tolerance against\nthese targets (such as a 10–15 percent increase in sales). Forecast benefits are checked through the\nproject (at a minimum at the end of every stage), and if they fall outside of set tolerances, they should be\nescalated to the appropriate level for review and action. Ensuring benefits are measurable also ensures\nthat they can be demonstrated. If the project includes benefits that cannot be measured, it is impossible\nto determine whether it has been a success or provided value for money.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n5\n-\nB\nu\ns\nn\ne\ns\ns\ni\nc\na\ns\ne\n59"

Benefits\ntolerance is documented in the business case.\nSustainability tolerance The permissible deviation in the sustainability performance targets\nthat is allowed before the deviation needs to be escalated to the next level of management.\nSustainability tolerance is documented in the business case.\n5.2.3 Establishing business justification\nAll seven aspects of the project’s performance targets (see 1.4) and their relationships with each other\nshould be considered as part of assessing the business justification, but there will often be trade-offs\nbetween different performance aspects. For example, if in developing the project product description it is\ndecided that higher quality targets are required, it is likely to impact the cost, time, or sustainability targets.\nThe business case considers options to achieve the required outcomes (PRINCE2 refers to these\noutcomes as the ‘business options’) and selects the option that gives the best balance between the\ndifferent performance aspects. If a project cannot build a business case within the tolerances set for all\nseven performance aspects, then its justification may be questionable.\nThe business case should include not only the costs of developing the project product but also any\nchanges to operational costs when the project concludes. Most organizations have policies that define\nhow these costs should be considered in their business cases.\nDis-benefits are expected consequences of an activity, whereas a risk is uncertain and may never\nmaterialize. For example, a decision to merge two elements of an organization into a new site may have\nbenefits (such as better joint working), costs (such as expanding one of the two sites), and dis-benefits\n(such as limited public transport options to the new site). Dis-benefits need to be valued and\nincorporated into the investment appraisal.\n5.3 Techniques\n5.3.1 PRINCE2 technique for business case management\nPRINCE2 includes a four-step business case management technique (develop, check, maintain, confirm)\nas shown in figure 5.3. An alternative procedure can be used in its place if desired, for example, if the\nbusiness has already developed a procedure specific to their organization. The use of an alternative\nprocedure should be documented as part of the tailoring decisions in the project initiation\ndocumentation.\nThe business case is developed in outline and then in detail at the beginning of the project. It is\nreviewed and updated as it develops and evolves throughout the life of the project (see figure 5.2). It is\nchecked by the project board at each key decision point (such as at stage boundaries) and confirmed\nthroughout the period that benefits accrue.\n60"

In the process of directing a project, the project brief\nis approved by the project board when authorizing the project initiation.

The difference between do nothing differently, do the minimum, or do more than the\nminimum is the benefit that the investment will buy.\nThe analysis of each option provides the project board and the project’s stakeholders with sufficient\ninformation to determine which option presents the best value for the organization. It answers the\nquestion: for this level of investment, are the expected benefits more desirable, viable, and achievable\nthan the other available options? See 5.3.2.1 Investment Appraisal techniques for a summary of some of\nthe ways in which options can be evaluated and compared.\nDuring the early stages of a project, there may be a wide range of options under consideration, and\nsubsequently, the number of options will be reduced so that they can be examined in more detail. It is\nimportant for all projects including those classified as ‘must do’ (such as regulatory projects) to explore\ndifferent options and select the most appropriate.

Continued business justification drives all\ndecision-making by ensuring that the business objectives and benefits being sought can continue to be\nrealized. As a minimum, the project board should check the business case:\n● at the end of the process of starting up a project to authorize project initiation\n● at the end of the process of initiating a project to authorize the project\n● at the end of each stage to authorize the next stage and the continuation of the project\n● when assessing an exception plan to authorize the revised stage and continuation of the project.\nThe project manager will also check the business case:\n● when assessing progress, risks, and issues to determine their impact on the business justification\n● during the final stage, as part of closing a project, to assess the project’s performance against\nrequirements and the probability that the outcomes will provide the expected benefits\n● when consulting with stakeholders to determine whether any goals have changed (such as whether\nany additional sustainability objectives have been established by the business).\nThere are many ways to check the expected benefits. For example, sensitivity analysis can be used to\ndetermine whether the business case is heavily dependent on a specific benefit. If it is, this may affect\nproject planning, monitoring and control activities, and risk management, as steps would need to be\ntaken to protect that specific benefit.\n62"

It is important to maintain the business case with appropriate version control so\nthat previous versions can be accessed for reference and comparison.\n5.3.1.4 Confirm\nThe business will review the business case as part of a post-project benefits review to determine the\nproject outcomes in realizing their benefits. They will also assess whether the intended benefits have\nbeen realized in practice. During the project, benefits reviews should be conducted at stage boundaries\nto confirm that any benefits forecast to be achieved during the project are on track to be realized.\nAs shown in figure 5.1 (see section 5.1), projects deliver outputs, and the use of those outputs will result\nin outcomes that provide benefits to the business. It is important that the project management team\nunderstands the benefits and outcomes the project should realize. Otherwise, it is unlikely to be able to\ndevelop the right outputs or build and sustain commitment to the changes during the project’s lifespan.\nThe senior user, who is responsible for specifying the benefits from the project, is also accountable for\nconfirming that the forecast benefits are realized. This may involve a commitment beyond the life of the\nproject, as it is likely that many benefits will not be realized until after the project has closed. For this\nreason, it is usually advisable that the senior user comes from an area of the business impacted by the\nchange. However, this poses a dilemma because when the project closes, the ‘temporary organization’\nis disbanded along with the framework (and in particular the funding and resources) to perform any\nmeasurement activities.\nThe benefits management approach defines the management actions that will be established to ensure\nthat the project’s outcomes are achieved and to confirm that the project’s benefits are realized. It is first\ncreated by the project manager in the ‘initiating a project’ process during the initiation stage and is\nsubmitted to the project board for approval when seeking project authorization. If the business is to\nmanage or participate in the benefits reviews, the project board may need to seek its approval. The\nbenefits management approach may be managed by the project or by the business and is likely to be\nmanaged beyond the life of the project.\nAny benefits that can be measured during the life of a project should be confirmed by the senior user\nfor formal reporting by the project manager in the end stage reports and end project report. When\nbenefits can be reviewed during the life of the project, the benefits management approach should\ninclude appropriate mid-project benefits reviews. Any forecast benefits that are unrealized should be\nre-examined and their forecasts updated as part of the ‘managing a stage boundary’ process.\nPost-project benefits reviews will involve the business holding the senior user accountable by asking for\nevidence of how the individual benefits allocated to them have been realized, with corrective actions\ntaken to achieve benefits that have not been fully realized. The post-project benefits reviews will also\nreview the performance of the project product in operational use and identify whether there have been\nany side effects (beneficial or adverse) that may provide useful lessons for other projects.\nThe project executive is responsible for ensuring that benefits reviews are planned and executed. For\npost-project measurement activities, the responsibility for benefits reviews transfers from the project\nexecutive to the business (specifically the senior user) when the project closes, as the reviews will need\nto be funded and resourced.\n63\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n5\n-\nB\nu\ns\nn\ne\ns\ns\ni\nc\na\ns\ne"

The investment appraisal looks at the\nrelationship between benefits, costs, and risks. It should cover both the project costs (both in producing\nthe required products and the project management costs) and the ongoing operations and\nmaintenance costs.\nThere are many investment appraisal techniques available to organizations that will often have\npreferences on which technique to adopt for specific projects. The selection of techniques may be\ninfluenced by the type of business (such as those that have to follow public sector accounting rules) or\nthe organization’s own standards.\nExamples of investment appraisal techniques include the following:\n● Whole life costs analysing the total cost of implementation and any incremental transitional,\noperational, and maintenance costs\n● Net benefits analysing the total value of the benefits minus the cost of implementation, transition,\nand ongoing operation, calculated over a defined period\n● Return on investment (ROI) profits or savings resulting from investments expressed as a\npercentage of the initial investment\n● Payback a measure of time to remunerate the investment of cash and other resources\n● Net present value (NPV) an amount of money that the investment will have earned by a particular\npoint in time that considers the time value of money using a discount rate to determine discounted\ncash flows (For example, if the discount rate is six percent, the value of money halves approximately\nevery 12 years. Therefore, if a project is forecasting a £500,000 benefit to materialize in year 12, then\nit is only worth £250,000 in today’s money.)\n● Internal rate of return a percentage that indicates the rate of return on investment when the NPV\nis zero\n● Options analysis a comparison of the options by scoring each option against weighted assessment\ncriteria to help identify a preferred option (Pairwise comparison can also be used to differentiate\nbetween options to establish the shortlist and preferred option.)\n● Sensitivity analysis adjusting the input factors to model the point at which the output factors no\nlonger justify the investment.\n● For example, a project might be worthwhile if it can be done in four months but ceases to be\nworthwhile if it was to take six months.\n● Business cases are based on uncertain forecasts. To identify how robust the business case is, it is\nuseful to understand the relationship between input factors (such as project costs, timescale,\nquality, scope, and project risks) and output factors (such as operations and maintenance costs,\nbusiness benefits, and business risks).\n64"

Examples of some\ndifferent investment perspectives include:\n● Strategic perspective understanding the drivers for change and demonstrating how the\ninvestment provides strategic fit\n● Economic perspective identifying the option that delivers best value, including wider social,\nenvironmental, and sustainability considerations\n● Financial perspective assessing affordability, funding, budgeting, and cashflow over the life of the\nproject and project product\n● Implementation and commercial perspective showing that the preferred option can be delivered\nby service providers and that robust arrangements are established for successful project delivery.\nFor an investment to be robust, it should be able to demonstrate that it satisfies all these perspectives.\nThe business may have developed its own set of cases for developing business cases, such as an\nenvironmental case, and policies regarding their use.\n5.3.2.3 Best, expected, and worst-case scenarios for benefits\nWhen using iterative-incremental approach, such as agile, the scope of the project is typically flexible in\norder to embrace adaptability and to reassure the project will be completed in the fixed time and\nbudget. Therefore, benefits should be expressed not as a target estimate but rather in the form of a\nrange, relating to the amount of scope delivered.\nOne way to present the estimation of the benefits is to present different scenarios for the scope and\nthe benefits in a business case, for example:\n● best-case scenario describing benefits expected when all (must-, should-, and could-have)\nrequirements are delivered\n● expected-case scenario describing benefits expected when must-have and should-have\nrequirements are delivered\n● worst-case scenario describing benefits expected when only must-have requirements are delivered.\nThe worst-case scenario showing the lowest expectation of the amount of scope delivered should also\nshow that the project is still viable.\n5.4 Applying the practice\n5.4.1 Organizational context\nA project needs to align its approach to developing and maintaining the business case with wider\nbusiness policies, standards, and approaches.

The customer needs to ensure that its project is viable, and the\nrisks are acceptable, considering the suppliers chosen. A supplier would have to ensure that it will\nbenefit from the work it undertakes on the project. In other words, that it would be worthwhile from the\nsupplier’s perspective.\nSuccessful projects ensure these business cases are aligned and compatible recognizing that there may\nbe elements of each business case that are private to each organization. It is the responsibility of the\nproject executive to ensure compatibility through the alignment of the three project interests of the\nuser, the business, and the supplier on the project board.\n5.4.3 Delivery method\nAn iterative-incremental approach may require more information on the benefit tolerances, priorities,\nand timescales. Additionally, it may also need details of the extent and sequence of the scope to be\ndelivered. Given the fixed cost and time, one way to present a business case is to show the best case,\nexpected case, and worst case of the scope that can be used.\nWhen creating a business case, it is important to understand how incremental delivery of a product and\nthe value associated with it could impact the project’s viability (positively or negatively) and also the\nability to achieve the early realization of some benefits. If there is a high level of uncertainty, the\nbusiness case should be developed, and the assumptions should be tested quickly.\nWhen using an iterative-incremental delivery method such as agile, the understanding of what is to be\ndelivered will increase throughout the project together with understanding the benefits. Thus, the\nbusiness case would evolve much more during the lifecycle of the project than for a linear-sequential\nproject. The business case may also be framed as having a worst-case scenario when only the “must\nhave” requirements are delivered and an expected-case scenario when the “must haves” and “should\nhaves” are delivered and a best-case scenario when the “could haves” are also delivered.\n5.4.4 Sustainability\nThe United Nations defines 17 sustainability development goals to improve health and education,\nreduce inequality, and encourage economic growth while tackling climate change. Many organizations\nhave signed up to align with these targets. Organizations may define specific business objectives related\nto improving sustainability, and specific organizational policies, targets, and frameworks to achieve their\nESG commitments. It is important that the sustainability targets for the project align with the\norganization’s broader objectives and any ESG targets it has defined.\nIf a project’s primary purpose is to satisfy a sustainability objective, then using traditional methods of\ninvestment appraisal may not be effective when assessing its business justification.

The approach to assessing business justification may need to be\nadapted for this type of project.\nBusiness case\nScenario: sustainability as a trade-off in options\nappraisal\nLouistown city council’s pledge to net zero within the next 10 years means it has\nset a finite allowance of greenhouse gas emissions across all activities by year. Of\nthis allowance, the LouisShopping project has been allocated a limit of 2.3 tons\nCO2e. This requires the project to make trade-offs in options regarding design, delivery, and\noperations/maintenance. As part of the project design, the project board has requested the\nproject team to complete an options analysis on what are the possible scenarios to meet\nsustainability standards and their implications.\nThe project team identified two key design decisions required and their trade-offs as follows.\nDesign decision\nOption A\nOption B\nIndoor air quality and\nventilation\nHigh-performance\nwindows\nUse enhanced mechanical ventilation.\nThis can improve indoor air quality and\nincrease the productivity of occupants in\ngreen buildings. However, it can lead to\nhigher carbon emissions compared with\nother ventilation systems.\nUsing large, double-glazed windows can\nimprove sleep quality at night and\nconsequently productivity at work, as\nwell as increase heat gain. Double-glazed\nwindows save energy and consequently,\nreduce carbon emissions.\nUse a balanced or fully ducted ventilation\nsystem. This is deemed the most effective\nsolution for creating a clean and optimum\nenvironment for employees as it utilizes\nfully controlled and balanced ventilation.\nAlthough less utilized than mechanical\nventilation, it produces less carbon\nemissions.\nInnovative water-filled windows that cool\nand reheat themselves, without needing an\nadditional energy supply, can save up to\n72 percent more energy than buildings\nfitted with traditional heating systems and\ndouble-glazed windows. However, this\nsolution is not yet tested in a retail building\ncontext.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n5\n-\nB\nu\ns\nn\ne\ns\ns\ni\nc\na\ns\ne\nBased on the council’s commitment to net zero, a decision was made to use a balanced ventilation\nsystem instead of an enhanced mechanical ventilation. The project board also agreed that water-filling\nwindows, although producing better results regarding carbon emissions, would bring a high-level risk to\nthe project. Hence, they decided to proceed with double-glazed, a common approach used in retail\nconstruction.\n5.4.5 Scale\nThe format and detail of the business case needs to be adapted so that it is appropriate to the size and\ncomplexity of the project. For example, small, low value projects may merge the project brief and\nbusiness case into one simple business case document. On the contrary, large or complex projects may\nrequire more detail in the business case, such as including a detailed environmental impact study for\nlarge-scale infrastructure projects.\n67"

For a project to\nsucceed, it is essential to establish an effective project management team structure that supports\nnavigating this complexity. For this reason, one of PRINCE2’s principles is that projects must define\nroles, responsibilities, and relationships for the project within an organizational structure that engages\nwith and represents the interests of business, user, and supplier communities.\nTo be flexible and meet the needs of different contexts, PRINCE2 defines a set of roles that need to be\nundertaken, together with the responsibilities of each of those roles. PRINCE2 does not define tasks to\nbe allocated to people on a one-to-one basis. Roles can be shared or combined within certain\nconstraints according to the project’s needs, but responsibilities must always be allocated.\nDefinition: Role\nThe function assigned to a group or individual in a particular project.

The team has\nagreed that the team manager role will be held collectively by the whole team.\nThis means that all the areas of the team manager’s responsibility will be the responsibilities of\nthe whole team and each individual member of the team. These areas of responsibility include\nplanning, monitoring and managing progress, managing issues and risks, obtaining acceptance,\nand handover of products. The team has also appointed one person, the single point of contact\nfor the project manager, with whom the project manager will liaise and who will provide the\nproject manager with all the information they need. All the agile team role names will remain the\nsame. These team arrangements have been accepted by the project manager as an appropriate\ntailoring of the PRINCE2 method at the team level.\n6.2.4.7 Project assurance\nProject board members are accountable for the assurance of their respective areas of concern\n(business assurance, user assurance, supplier assurance). The project board is responsible for\nestablishing how project assurance will be undertaken, ensuring clarity in the roles and responsibilities\nand how those appointed to assurance roles will interact with each other. Subject to who has the\nknowledge, skills, and capacity to support the project team, the assurance tasks can be undertaken by\nthe board member themselves, appointed from the wider business, or selected from an external party.\nProject assurance roles cannot be assigned to the project manager, team manager, project team\nmembers, nor the project support. Where the project assurance roles are delegated, the respective\nproject board member remains accountable.\n6.2.4.8 Project support\nProject support is responsible for providing services such as, administrative support, facilitating\nmeetings and workshops, advice and guidance on the project tools, planning support, risk management,\nissue management, and change management.\nAlthough the role is the responsibility of the project manager, it can be delegated to suppliers,\nindividuals, or groups within the business or to other team members. This is dependent on the scale\nand complexity of the project and the skills, knowledge, and capacity of the project manager. Some\norganizations establish a project office to support the delivery of projects, which can fulfil this role (see\nPortfolio, Programme and Project Offices P3O).\nProject support can help with integration across the project ecosystem, including gaining feedback to\naid improvements to the ways of working, the evolving project direction, and building social cohesion.\nProject support must be kept separate from project assurance roles to maintain the independence of\nassurance.\n82"

The work breakdown structure creates a link between the work\npackages and the product breakdown structure (see Chapter 7), supporting the project manager in\ndetermining how to structure project teams and the boundaries between them.\nThe work breakdown structure is most useful when there are multiple work packages and particularly\nwhen there is a mix of internally staffed and externally supplied work packages. For the former, it makes\nclear the level of effort of internal staff, and for the latter, it is useful in creating a statement of the work\nrequired. However, for a very simple project, such as the delivery of just one work package with a small\nteam, a work breakdown structure would not be required.\nIf a single work package is being used in the project, it is best that it does not include both internal and\nexternal team members. There is a fundamentally different character and set of relationships between\nan internal agreement and an external contract. Therefore, it is better to manage them separately.\n6.3 Techniques\n6.3.1\nPRINCE2 technique for organizational design and\ndevelopment\nA number of the areas mentioned in Chapter 3 (People) can be addressed by proactive organizational design\nand development, including culture, collaboration, relationships, and ultimately, effective project teams.\nPRINCE2 includes a five-step organizational design and development technique shown in figure 6.4. An\nalternative procedure can be used instead, for example, if the business has already developed a\nprocedure specific to their organization. The use of an alternative procedure should be documented as\npart of the tailoring decisions in the project initiation documentation.\nUnderstand\norganizational\necosystem\nDesign project\necosystem\nDevelop\nproject\necosystem\nManage\nchanges to\nproject\necosystem\nTransition\nproject into\norganizational\necosystem\nFigure 6.4 PRINCE2 technique for organizational design and development\n83\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n6\n-\nO\nr\ng\na\nn\nz\nn\ng\ni\ni"

An understanding of the organizational ecosystem is required to\nsuccessfully design the project organization and determine how the project ecosystem will develop as a\ndistinct entity from the organizational ecosystem.\nAs a temporary organization, the project approach needs to define how the project will interface and\nalign with the organizational ecosystem where required. There should be clarity on who retains\nresponsibility for issues such as:\n● People management for example, performance management, rewards, advancement, and\nwellbeing\n● Governance for example, which decisions are subject to corporate governance or governance\npathways\n● Management approaches such as policies, procedures, and ways of working\n● How and when the transition of project team members on and off the project.\n6.3.1.2 Design the project ecosystem\nProject organizational design describes how to organize work and people to achieve the project’s\nobjectives. This includes:\n● determining the effective structure of the team\n● determining the people and resources needed\n● implementing integrated working practices\n● developing the project behaviours and culture.\nThe design occurs in response to the understanding of the needs of the project across each of its\nstages, the context it is working within, and the skills, capability, and capacity of the people required or\nassigned to the project.\nSubject to the project’s scale, complexity, project approach, and delivery method, the organizational\nstructure may need to transition at different stages of the project, such as moving from a client-led\ndesign team to a supplier-led delivery team. Where possible, this should be identified and planned for\nduring the initiation stage, establishing planned project management team structures at different\nstages. Consideration is needed regarding the people and resources needed to support the transition\nbetween these different structures and the impact of the changes on the project team.\nThe project organizational design is informed by the work breakdown structure and the commercial\nmanagement approach. These will determine the number and size of teams, which organizations they\ncome from, and the nature of any customer or supplier relationships required. The capabilities required\nof a project delivered by people entirely from within the business will be quite different from those\nrequired of a project mostly delivered by external suppliers.\nThe project executive, supported by the project manager, is responsible for the project organizational\ndesign. It should be documented in the project initiation documentation. Organizational design for\nprojects requires expertise that is distinctly different from the business’ organizational design due to\nthe temporary and ever-evolving nature of projects. Subject to the scale and complexity of the project,\nthe project executive may need to delegate this responsibility either within the organization, if they have\nthis skillset, or to outsource the responsibility to a specialist supplier.\n84"

It is critical to have clear feedback loops established to determine\nwhether there are any capability or capacity gaps or relational issues to address.\nThe project manager is responsible for making the best use of the people and resources available,\nenhancing capabilities where required. They do so by ensuring people’s responsibilities are matched to\ntheir capability and capacity, sourcing additional skills and capabilities, or upskilling people through\ncoaching and learning opportunities.\nThe capabilities required on a project will change over the project lifecycle, requiring the project manager\nto ensure the commercial management approach supports this, transitioning people onto and off the\nproject as required, and enhancing capacity and capabilities. The project manager must also ensure that a\nrobust change management procedure is established to ensure the impact on different areas of the\nproject ecosystem are considered in decision-making. One way this can be done is to identify the new\ncapabilities that the products will provide and review any barriers to getting this new capability embedded\ninto business as usual activities. Clarifying these barriers early in the project lifecycle will highlight new\nproject risks or issues and establish expectations on a realistic time frame for benefits realization.\nA project stage is often defined by these transition points in the required capabilities. This is a good\npoint to review the project management team structure and the associated roles and responsibilities,\nensuring that the commercial management approach supports the proposed changes.\n6.3.1.5 Transition the project into the organizational ecosystem\nAs with the start of a project, at the close of a project, it is important to understand the organizational\necosystem that the products of the project and any remaining project team members will be transitioning\ninto. There are three key aspects the project board needs to consider as part of the transition:\n● Products ensuring all products have been accepted into the business and that any ongoing\nactivities associated with the products such as further developments, monitoring the benefits,\noperating, and maintaining the products are owned by appropriate areas of the business\n● People ensuring any remaining project team members are successfully transitioned back into the\nbusiness or are managed in line with the commercial arrangements for external suppliers\n● Learning ensuring the most effective means for sharing lessons and using the knowledge gained, in\nundertaking project work, project team members may have acquired skills and capabilities that will\nlikely benefit the wider business and organizations involved.\n6.3.2 Supporting techniques\nOther techniques that can be used on a PRINCE2 project include delivery models or a RACI matrix.\n6.3.2.1 Delivery models\nWhere the capacity or capabilities required do not already exist in an organization, and there is no long\nterm need to develop them, the project may choose to bring in external suppliers, either as additional\npeople to support the project or outsourcing some or all of the product delivery.

It is described in the commercial management approach and reflected in the\nproject management team structure.\nDelivery models can range from thin client models where most of the project work is undertaken by\nsuppliers to thick client models where most of the work is undertaken by the business. In thin client\nmodels, not only is the work to develop the project products fulfilled by external suppliers, but also\nmuch of the work to manage the project is fulfilled by external suppliers too.\nThe delivery model will define which aspects of project management will be in-house or external. It will\nalso include whether the work fulfilled by external suppliers will be contracted on a product or labour\nbasis. The distinction is that contracting on a labour basis means the client generally remains\nresponsible for the performance of their work, whereas on a product basis, the supplier remains\nresponsible for their performance.\nThe project board, in consultation with the project manager, is responsible for determining the right\nbalance between in-house and external suppliers and the commercial arrangements required between\nthem. This is captured in the commercial management approach.\nThe choice of delivery model can also be impacted by how unique the project is to the business. For\nhighly unique projects or where the project could become political, the project board may choose a\nmodel with a high level of organizational input to the assurance of the work. Whereas, for more\nstandardized work or where the project board (as the governing body) does not have the technical\ncapability or understanding to make informed decisions or appropriately challenge the project teams, a\nmodel utilizing the expertise of external suppliers to assure the work and support decision-making may\nbe chosen. The delivery model should support risk being allocated to the part of the organizational\necosystem most capable of managing the risk.\nScenario: example of a delivery model\nSince NowByou did not have professional project management capability\nin-house, a make-or-buy decision had to be made on how to deliver the new\ncampaign against discrimination. Due to the limited funding available to\nNowByou, it relied mostly on donations, and this decision was severely\nconstrained by the resources available.\nCost was a major driver to not hire a specialist project management provider such as a consulting\ncompany. Nonetheless, NowByou understands that professional project management is an\nenabler of successful campaigns and vital to its long-term strategy.\nSubsequently, a managerial decision was made to contract a professional project manager to set\nthe foundations for good practices at NowByou and whose responsibility is also to build the\nproject management capabilities of internal staff. The other aspects of the project will be\ndelivered internally, except for elements of consultation which will be undertaken by a number of\nvoluntary organizations that NowByou collaborates with.\n87\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n6\n-\nO\nr\ng\na\nn\nz\nn\ng\ni\ni"

A RACI chart is a matrix of all the activities or decision-making\nauthorities in the project that shows the people or roles involved. RACI stands for:\n● Responsible one or more people who perform the task\n● Accountable the single person who ‘owns’ the task\n● Consulted the people whose input is required for the task\n● Informed the people who are informed of progress or completion of the task.\nAs there are usually many different people involved in any task, and they have differing responsibilities,\na RACI chart makes the relationships and the authorities explicit. The benefits of a RACI chart include:\n● clarity of ownership\n● clear responsibility for delivery\n● stronger teamwork\n● visual format that reduces confusion and ensures there are no gaps.\n6.4 Applying the practice\n6.4.1 Organizational context\nProjects exists within a wider organizational context from being a one-off project delivered in-house\nwithin a functional structure to being part of a programme or portfolio of work delivered through\nmultiple organizations working in project teams. A project that forms part of a programme may find that\nmany of the change management activities referenced in Chapter 3 (people) will be co-ordinated and\nperformed at the programme level and may be impacted by the programme structure and its various\nreporting requirements.\nThe programme and project management team structures and roles need to be integrated such that:\n● there are clear lines of responsibility and accountability from top to bottom\n● duplication is avoided\n88"

There\nmay be political aspects of the business to consider when defining the project’s organizational\nstructure. These will have an impact on the commercial management approach and issues such as how\nrisk and reward is allocated, in particular, the track record of the business in delivering projects and\ncompeting interests on issues such as competition for the same people and resources.\nThere are numerous ways to structure the project management team roles in a commercial customer-\nsupplier context. The aim is to ensure that both organizations establish and maintain sound business\njustification for their work and that their individual governance is respected.\nExplored below are some commercial context considerations:\n● The project manager needs to have a good understanding of their obligations under any contract\nwith the supplier organization. The project manager will normally come from the customer\norganization. The supplier’s staff may fulfil some of the team manager roles for the project, and they\nmay even be called project managers in the supplier’s organization. Clarity is required regarding\ndifferences in job title compared to the title of their project role.\n● There may be projects where the project manager comes from the supplier’s organization. The\ncustomer may choose to stay at a distance from the working level and expect the supplier to provide\nthe management of the project. The customer is likely to increase the rigour in project assurance\nand indeed may choose to appoint one of its own staff to fulfil the role of project assurance.\n● There may be a joint project board with representatives from the customer and all the suppliers that\nthe customer has engaged. The project executive on this joint project board may be supplied by the\ncustomer, and the senior suppliers will represent each of the suppliers.\n● The supplier may treat their work packages within the customer’s project as a project within the\nsupplier’s organization. This may mean establishing a separate supplier project board. The\nrelationship between any such boards and the customer’s project board should be defined.\n● If there are multiple suppliers, all of them may be represented on the project board as it provides a\nforum for them to integrate direction and decision-making. However, if there are more than three or\nfour suppliers, then it will be typically more effective for the contracts manager responsible for the\nperformance of all the supplier contracts to sit on the project board on their behalf. Or it may be\nappropriate to appoint a prime contractor. The decision on whether to include external suppliers on\n89\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n6\n-\nO\nr\ng\na\nn\nz\nn\ng\ni\ni"

BuildyBrick, the main\ncontractor, is responsible for presenting design options that enable the\ninfrastructure to be consistent with the environment. This is while also offering\nmodern facilities supported by the latest technology.\nTo allow the project board to ask questions about BuildyBrick’s design proposals and receive\ncomplete and prompt responses and advice directly from the supplier, who retains technical\nexpertise, the project manager has requested a permanent board arrangement. Representatives\nof BuildyBrick attend the first part of every meeting. This is where a status update on design and\ndelivery is presented, whereas the other part of the meeting is focused on matters related to the\ninternal business case.\n6.4.3 Delivery method\nWhen a project is deploying a specific delivery method, the project manager will need to understand:\n● How will the roles prescribed by the delivery method align to PRINCE2 roles? In some cases, a simple\nchange of terminology and minor amendments to the role description will suffice. For example,\niterative-incremental product development techniques often include the role of product owner,\nwhich could be aligned to the senior user role. In other cases, distinct roles may need to be added to\nthe project management team structure along with agreement on how they relate to the PRINCE2\nroles.\n● How will the project manager liaise with teams when they are using different delivery methods from\neach other (such as a hybrid of linear-sequential and iterative-incremental)?\n● If self-organizing delivery teams are used, how do they relate to the team manager role? Would the\nteam manager role be held by a scrum master, held collectively by team members, or the\nresponsibilities of team manager would be split between team members, product owner, and scrum\nmaster?\nThe use of management by exception is essential to enable the PRINCE2 method and iterative-\nincremental techniques to work together in the most effective way. This empowers the project\nmanagement team and enables it to self-organize within clearly defined boundaries. (More details about\nhow to combine PRINCE2 with iterative-incremental techniques can be found in PRINCE2 Agile.)\n90"

This typically includes targets for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) objectives, the\nUN’s sustainable development goals (SDG), net zero, waste reduction targets, reuse of materials, the\ndecommissioning approach, and so on.\nProjects are often the vehicle for driving forward an organization’s sustainability targets, whether that is\ntheir primary focus or as a by-product of how they are delivered. To support this, there should be clear\naccountability for sustainability targets across the project ecosystem captured in the business case, the\nrequirement setting, and people’s role descriptions. The organization of the project impacts its ability to\ndeliver sustainably. The project approach should empower team members to deliver sustainably,\nembedding sustainability considerations into all decision-making and ensuring a diversity of\nperspectives to challenge the way things have always been done.\nThe project management team structure and role descriptions should define responsibilities for\ndelivering the sustainability targets, including how they will be managed once the project is concluded.\nThe commercial management approach should ensure that the way products are ethically procured,\nand the performance measures applied enables meeting sustainability targets.\nScenario: representation on the project board\nSustainability concerns are not just about the environment but also manifest on\nhow organizations manage the impact of their projects on local communities.\nBecause NowByou is targeting the homeless and refugees as two key groups\ncovered by the new campaign, the NGO wants to put their words into action. It\nhas invited two local organizations close to its headquarters to be actively involved in the\ncampaign and have a seat on the project board with the role of senior user.\nThese two organizations will help the project team to understand the impact on the local\ncommunity and that their interests are being taken into consideration. They will also ensure that\nthe decisions being made offer a sustainable outcome that could last beyond the campaign.\n6.4.5 Scale\nOn a large, complex project, the project management team structure could include breaking the\nPRINCE2 roles into multiple appointments. For example, several senior users or senior suppliers could\nbe appointed. However, it is good practice to keep the size of the project board as small as possible,\nwhile still representing all business, user, and supplier interests. On smaller, simpler projects, people\nworking on the project may be assigned multiple roles, so long as the separation from the project\nmanager to the project executive and project assurance is observed.\nAnother aspect of large, complex projects is that there is often a need for the project board to delegate\nauthority to approve requests for change or off-specification, so they are not overwhelmed with\nrequests or experience slow progress in responding to them.\nThe project board may choose to establish a change authority, distinct from the project manager, which\nreports to the project board.

For example, a plan that details what the day-by-day activities of team members will be a\nyear or more in the future will almost certainly be inaccurate.\nThe PRINCE2 principle of manage by stages addresses the need to keep plans within reasonable\nplanning horizons. For this reason, a PRINCE2 project has:\n● a project plan as a high-level description of how and when the project’s objectives are to be achieved\nand show the major products, activities, and required people and resources (It provides a baseline\nagainst which to monitor progress throughout the life of the project.)\n● a stage plan for the current stage as a detailed document, based on more precise estimates that are\nachievable within the planning horizon.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n7\n-\nP\na\nn\ns\nl\nScenario: illustrating a sensible planning horizon\nAs a complex infrastructure project where the work is performed consecutively\nand multiple dependencies must be managed, it is fundamental that appropriate\nplanning is available for the implementation of the LouisShopping project.\nHowever, the project spans three financial years and is just starting the design\nstage. Hence, it would not be realistic to attempt the development of a detailed plan to show what\neach team member is doing for the next two years, as it will likely become inaccurate within a\nshort time span.\nTherefore, a sensible and effective approach to project planning would be to combine planning\nhorizons and levels of detail. This would be achieved by producing an outline plan for the next\ntwo years remaining in the project (long-term) while building a detailed plan for the current design\nstage (short-term). Additionally, as a commercial firm is to be selected through a tendering\nexercise, the stage plans for construction stages will require collaboration between the Louistown\ncity council and the supplier. This will only be finalized following the contract award.\nScenario: scope uncertainty and short planning horizon\nDue to high uncertainty of the scope of the Findef project and the iterative-\nincremental approach for the development of each product, the project\nmanager suggested that the duration of the individual stages of the project\nwould not exceed 1 month. At the end of each stage, the project manager and\nthe project board will have an opportunity to redefine the scope, plan the next stage in detail,\nand if needed, redirect the project to achieve as much value out of the products and\nrequirements delivered as possible.

A greater number of stages increases the degree of control, but every stage boundary\nrequires effort to manage. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the degree of control and the level of\nmanagement overhead on the project.\nFor a simple project with a small number of well-understood products and mature delivery method,\nonly two stages may be required. These are an initiation stage to prepare the project initiation\ndocumentation and a single delivery stage.\nFor a larger project with a complex set of products and a mix of delivery methods, multiple delivery\nstages, each with their own products and stage boundaries, will be required. This approach allows the\nproject management team to refine its estimates in each stage plan and the project board to confirm\nthat the project is continuing to satisfy its business justification.\nFor an iterative-incremental project, the project plan may provide multiple delivery stages in which the\nquality and acceptance criteria are refined in parallel with development of the required products\nthrough the use of a product backlog.\nSome projects may need to align stage boundaries with external events.

Stage breaks can be\ninserted at key points where risks to the project can be reviewed before major commitment of resources.\n● The planning horizon If there is significant uncertainty in the estimates of resources or of the\nduration of activities, a shorter stage can allow these estimates to be refined in the next stage plan.\n● Appropriate decision points Stage boundaries should be aligned with critical decisions to be made\nby the project board (such as whether and how to continue after delivery of a prototype) or\nbusiness layer decisions or events (such as a business planning cycle).\n● Alignment with programme activities Programmes may be organized around groups of projects\nstructured around distinct changes in capability and delivery tranches.

This means that planning in PRINCE2 focuses on identifying\nthe required products first and then determining the most effective way to deliver them. Users tend to\ncare most about the outputs they expect from a project, so a focus on products helps the project\nmanagement team avoid activities that do not contribute in a substantive way to the required outputs.\nThe focus on products also helps the project manager know where to start when developing plans.\nWhen the products required from the project are understood, it becomes easier to determine the\nproject approach, the necessary people and resources, realistic timelines, and the likely risks and issues.\nBy clearly and consistently identifying and documenting the products to be produced by the plan and\nthe interdependencies between them, product-based planning reduces the risk of scope being\nneglected or overlooked. It also helps establish agreement on one aspect crucial to ensuring project\nsuccess, which is a clear definition of what is and what is not within the project’s scope.\nProduct-based planning simplifies the identification of the work packages and the sequencing of these\nwork packages. This advantage continues into subordinate plans, such as stage plans and team plans.\nFinally, if the project encounters exceptions, product-based planning helps exception plans focus on\nresolving the exception with minimal impact on cost and schedule.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n7\n-\nP\na\nn\ns\nl\n7.3 Techniques\n7.3.1 PRINCE2 technique for planning\nPRINCE2 includes a planning technique based on product-based planning shown in figure 7.3. An\nalternative planning procedure can be used in its place if desired, for example, if the business has\nalready developed a procedure specific to their organization. The use of an alternative procedure\nshould be documented as part of the tailoring decisions in the project initiation documentation.\nProduct-based planning takes the definition and analysis of the required products as the starting point\nfor planning and deriving any supporting elements of the plan from these product descriptions, such as\nthe work breakdown structure, estimates, and project schedule.\nThe planning technique is not strictly sequential. For example, scheduling and estimating are often\ninterdependent and performed in a collaborative manner. On the other hand, the preparation of the\nbudget is usually more efficient when the product descriptions, work package descriptions, and\nschedule are relatively mature.\n107"

Each product is divided into its component elements in a hierarchical manner, and the\nrequirements for those elements are collected.\nAs an example, in the Louistown City Council project the major product is the shopping mall and its\nsurrounding pathways, plaza, and gardens. The shopping mall can be further divided into the enabling\nworks, the mall, the mall tenants, and operational readiness. The product breakdown structure can\nalso show external products which the project is dependent on. In this case, this is the connections to\nthe shopping mall comprising the revised public transport routes and timetable, and the park and ride\nscheme.\nLouisShopping\nConnections\nShopping mall\nPathways, Plaza, Gardens\nRevised bus routes\nand timetable\nRevised rail\ntimetable\nPark & ride\nEnabling works\nMall\nMall tenants\nOperational\nreadiness\nCleared & secured\nsite\nSubstructure\nTenants secured\nOperations needs\nassessment\nUtilities\nSuperstructure\nFit-out for tenants\nOperations plan\nExternal\nproduct\nSystems\nMechanical,\nElectrical,\nPlumbing\nTenants ready\nMobilised\noperations\nFigure 7.5 Product breakdown structure for LouisShopping project\nA function of a product breakdown structure is to allow requirements specific to one product or\ncomponent to be grouped together in a logical manner.

In the house example, the land is likely purchased in a different way\nand from a different source than the construction of the house.\nIt may be worth considering whether to include different states of a particular product. For example,\nthe mall may start as a design from an architect, then become a construction effort by a construction\nteam, and then a decorator for the interior finishing. Although the owner’s goal is to obtain a building\nwith units which can be let to tenants, there may be quality specifications for each state.\n7.3.2.3 Writing product descriptions\nIn the process of initiating a project, the required products are described in more detail. The project\nmanager elicits the user’s requirements for these products and documents them in one or more\nproduct descriptions. The project manager also consults with subject matter experts to determine\nrequirements related to how these products are procured, developed, tested, used, and supported\nafter acceptance. The aim of this more detailed step is to confirm that the requirements for the major\nproducts have been described in sufficient detail to enable realistic scheduling and estimation.\nThe definition and analysis of products may be an iterative procedure. In a linear-sequential project, the\nproduct descriptions should be sufficiently detailed to enable costs and time to be estimated at an\nappropriate level of confidence. However, in an iterative-incremental project, the detailed requirements\nfor products may be developed in parallel with the products themselves, and a high-level set of product\ndescriptions may be sufficient to proceed with the stage in which they are to be developed.\nProjects rarely have the luxury of fulfilling all user expectations without regard to constraints. For\nexample, a desirable product option that has a high energy demand may be in conflict with\nsustainability constraints set for the project. For this reason, it is helpful to prioritize quality\nspecifications for each product to ensure that the most important requirements are met.\n7.3.2.4 Creating a product flow diagram\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n7\n-\nP\na\nn\ns\nl\nDefinition: Product flow diagram\nA diagram showing the sequence of production and interdependencies of the products listed\nin a product breakdown structure.\nThe development of the product breakdown structure helps to identify dependencies among the\nproducts. These dependencies can be described in a product flow diagram, which illustrates the\nsequence in which the products in the plan will be developed and any dependencies between them.\nIn some cases, intermediate products will need to be delivered. Intermediate products are products\nthat are created as an essential input to the delivery of another product but not intended for use by the\nuser. For example, producing a prototype can be an effective way to reduce the risk of full-scale\nproduction, but the prototype itself is only the input to the full-scale production stage. The product flow\ndiagram and product breakdown structure must include both intermediate and final products, as well\nas any dependencies on external products outside the scope of the plan.\n111"

Each work package should combine closely related people,\nresources, and delivery activities. Also, each should create at least one required end product or an\nintermediate product required as an input to a subsequent work package.\nIf a work package depends on delivery of a product from another work package or from an activity\noutside the scope of the project, this relationship is considered a dependency.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n7\n-\nP\na\nn\ns\nl\nDefinition: Dependency\nA dependency means that one product is dependent on another. There are at least two types\nof dependency relevant to a project: internal and external.\nInternal dependency An internal dependency is one between two products of a project. In\nthese circumstances, the project team has control over the dependency.\nExternal dependency An external dependency is one between a project product and a\nproduct or activity outside the scope of the project. In these circumstances, the project team\ndoes not have complete control over the dependency.\nAll dependencies shown in the product flow diagram must be documented in the associated work\npackage description. Regardless of whether a contract is involved in the delivery of a work package (for\nexample, there may not be a contract for an internal supplier), a work package description is considered\nan agreement between the project manager and the team manager responsible for the work package.\nAlthough work packages are often interrelated, the project manager should ensure there is no overlap\nin the scope of any two work packages. This could incur unnecessary costs and create potential\nconflicts between teams. The totality of the work packages should comprise the full delivery scope of\nthe project. There should be no gaps between the product flow diagram, the product breakdown\nstructure, and the full set of work packages.\nIt can be useful to organize project management activities into a single work package for each stage,\neven if these activities are not considered part of the project budget. This helps document all project\nmanagement tasks and to show the relationship between stages and milestones and activities purely in\nrelation to product delivery.\nIn the PRINCE2 planning technique, the work breakdown structure (see Chapter 6) is a technique with\nseveral applications. It is used to support project organization by mapping work packages to the teams\nor suppliers responsible for delivering the associated products. This application is particularly helpful\nwhen a project has a mix of work packages, with one or more being delivered through internal staff and\nothers by external suppliers. Where people represent a major element of the project’s costs, the work\nbreakdown structure allows labour costs to be described in terms of types of skills, level of effort, and\nduration of effort.\n113"

The higher the level of confidence in an\nestimate, the less likely that unexpected variations will be encountered during delivery. This enables the\nproject manager and project board to agree to a realistic set of tolerances.\nExamples of estimating techniques are provided in section 7.3.4.\n7.3.2.7 Preparing a schedule\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n7\n-\nP\na\nn\ns\nl\nDefinition: Schedule\nA graphical representation of a plan (such as a Gantt chart), typically describing a sequence of\ntasks together with resource allocations, which collectively deliver the plan.\nThe sequencing, interrelationships, and duration of work packages and their associated tasks are\ncaptured in a schedule.

These activities, in turn, can be decomposed\ninto a set of tasks. For each task, the people and resources can be identified.

Their use will depend on the project\ncontext as to whether the value of the additional control outweighs the additional project management\ncosts and time.\n7.3.2.9 Analysing risks\nPlans need to be analysed for risks throughout the planning technique as the plan develops. As the\ndetail of the plan evolves, it should be examined for its potential risk content. All identified risks should\nbe entered into the project log: risk register.\nAfter the plan has been produced, the plan should still be considered as a draft until decisions\nregarding whether and how to treat the inherent risks in the plan have been made.

The\nschedule and budget may be maintained in separate systems or files. Meanwhile, the product\nbreakdown structure, product flow diagram, and work breakdown structure may be maintained in a\ndocument, spreadsheet, or graphical planning tool. Multiple elements may be maintained in a team\ncollaboration tool.

For example:\n● categorizing criteria as must-have, should-have, could-have, or won’t have\n● a product backlog approach that explains the sequence in which features will be made available to\nusers (or in which criteria will be met)\n● pairwise comparison to understand preferences between criteria\n● the Kano model that describes features as delighters, performance features, and essential as a\nmeans of gauging customer satisfaction\n● Eisenhower matrices, which assess criteria in two contrasting dimensions (for example, importance\nversus urgency or value versus ease of implementation).\nPrioritization techniques help to define scope tolerances, supporting the manage by exception\nprinciple.\n7.3.3.2 Scheduling\nProject schedules provide information on the sequencing, dependencies, and durations of activities,\nalong with milestones.

This presentation can be difficult to maintain for large projects or projects with frequent\nchanges in schedule.\n● Product checklist It is a list of the major products of the plan and the key dates in their delivery.\nWhen the planned and actual dates for delivery are displayed, this presentation provides a good\nsummary of delivery performance over the project lifecycle.\n● Activity flow board This technique shows how each product or product component progresses\nthrough the work of development or delivery.

A schedule with zero float across all\nactivities represents a high risk of delay and exception to the time tolerance.\nA critical path diagram illustrates the sequence of activities from the start to the end of the project that\nhave the least amount of total float. Any delay beyond the planned float between any two activities on\nthe critical path means the project will overrun its schedule.\nA weakness in the critical path diagram is that it does not address resource limitations. Therefore, it may\nbe useful to identify the critical chain as well. The critical chain is the sequence of tasks that, given\navailable resources, prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time given. In the example of\nthe house project, the critical chain might reflect the fact that local regulations prohibit outside\nconstruction work on weekends.\nBy identifying schedule constraints, the project manager is able to focus on changes in the schedule of\nactivities, critical path, or critical chain as potential exceptions. Moreover, the project manager can avoid\nexceptions by adjusting the timing of activities with the available float or resource flexibilities.\n7.3.4 Estimating\nA variety of estimating techniques are available to project managers. These include the following:\n● Top-down A top-down technique assumes that the costs, duration, and level of effort of the major\nproducts and work packages can be estimated to a high-level of confidence. These are then\nallocated to subordinate elements of the product breakdown structure and work breakdown\nstructure. This technique could be used for an iterative-incremental project in which delivery is\nstructured into stages and sprints with fixed timeframes and resources.\n● Bottom-up A bottom-up technique develops estimates for individual products, components,\nactivities, or tasks at their lowest level of definition. The lower-level estimates are then aggregated to\nobtain overall estimates. This technique is useful when the lower-level elements are well-understood\nbut will be combined in a manner unique to the project or new to the organization.\n● Comparative When the materials, products, or delivery work are well-understood and based on\ncommon practices, estimates can be developed based on similar projects or openly available market\ninformation.\n● Parametric When measured or when empirical data on materials, effort, and duration is available\nand supported by estimating models (such as in the construction industry), estimates can be\ndeveloped using values from the project, such as the number, units, or size of a structure.\n● Data analytics Descriptive analytics (understanding the characteristics of a task) and predictive\nanalytics (understanding a task’s predisposition to particular outcomes) can be used to help improve\nestimates. This will require access to data that may be generated by the project, held by the business\nlayer, or sourced from a data trust.\n● Subject matter expertise Consensus-based techniques, such as Delphi and planning poker, can be\nused to develop a consensus on estimates with the participation of subject matter experts.\nSeveral estimating techniques are often used in large and complex projects.

For example, the project budget may need to be prepared according to procedures for\nhandling capital investment expenditures. Projects in governmental or other public organizations may\nneed to comply with regulatory requirements and ensure transparency in record keeping.\nScenario: example of complying with regulations\nFindef’s change of business model means they are selling directly to consumers\nrather than via intermediaries such as the banks. This means they are now\nsubject to consumer protection regulations that had previously been the\nresponsibility of their intermediary. The FindefTwo programme commissioned a\nstudy to determine what changes they would need to make across the business to comply with\nconsumer protection regulations and any other regulations. The study revealed that the\nregulations also had requirements of product design. The requirements were fed into the\nproduct descriptions. The project team included additional reviews in the stage plans (stages 3, 4,\nand 5) to verify compliance with them.\nFor projects that are part of a programme, the programme management team may take a major\nsupporting role or even lead the planning for its projects. The programme may have dedicated planners\nthat can provide templates for management products and assist the project manager in preparing and\nmaintaining the project plan and stage plans.\nThe number and length of stages will be influenced by the programme plan. It may be desirable or\nnecessary to align stage reviews to programme milestones, for example, at the end of a tranche. The\nprogramme may even define a set of standard stages with which all projects within the programme\ncomply.\nThe programme delivery plan will detail which of the project products are being used by other projects\nwithin the programme. Any such dependencies to or from the project should be incorporated into the\nproject’s plans.\n7.4.2 Commercial context\nFor projects in a commercial context, the role of suppliers is an important consideration. Many projects\nrely on external suppliers to deliver work packages. This is one reason why it is useful to align work\npackages with their responsible suppliers, whether external or internal. However, when an external\nsupplier is responsible for a work package, this arrangement may be reflected through a formal\nagreement such as a contract.\nIt is recommended to ensure that the agreement requires the supplier’s plans to provide clear\ntraceability to the applicable elements of the user’s project plan.

For linear-sequential projects, most planning effort is applied upfront in the processes of\nstarting up a project and initiating a project. This is because these projects are often characterized by\nwell-understood products and mature delivery activities. The example of similar projects helps establish\nthe planning horizon and suggest the necessary products, work packages, and stages. Duration, level of\neffort, and costs can be estimated with a high level of confidence. The estimates in the project plan are\nrefined in stage plans, and team plans and product descriptions are further detailed in subsequent\nstages, but the project plan usually does not change unless there is a project level exception.\nOn the other hand, iterative-incremental projects focus on how much can be produced over a fixed\nperiod of time (such as a sprint or a timebox). This is with the goal of delivering an initial product quickly\nand refining and improving it iteratively.\nWhen an iterative-incremental approach such as agile is being used, a common planning approach\nwould consist of:\n● setting tolerances for each iteration that effectively fix time and cost and enable more flexibility in\nscope\n● producing the project product description in terms of expected outcomes and benefits\n● developing the user stories, epics, and product backlogs instead of product descriptions\n119"

Projects\nalso sometimes fail to achieve the expected benefits because there are only limited means to\nsustain these benefits. For example, ongoing training and user support are not considered when\ndefining the project’s scope. An effective way to avoid this problem is by identifying requirements to\nensure benefits sustainability.\n7.4.5 Scale\nThe PRINCE2 planning technique supports a wide range of projects. Although product-based planning\nalways applies, the level of effort involved in planning can easily be scaled up or down based on the\ncharacteristics and needs of the project.\nAspects of project scale that affect planning include:\n120"

      "content": "Plans\n● Duration The longer a project’s lifecycle, the more likely that project plans will need to adapt to\nchanges in both the external environment and internal project delivery activities. Duration should be\nconsidered in organizing work packages and stages, as well as in estimating the change budget. In\naddition, multi-year projects will likely see changes in the project team, including key roles such as\nthe project manager. Project plans should be prepared to aid orientation, continuity, and reduce the\nimpact of turnover.\n● Size of the project team Large and dispersed project teams will generally need more project\nsupport and benefit from easily accessible project planning and reporting tools and documentation.\n● Complexity Projects with a small number of products and work packages can be planned with\nrelatively simple documents and tools. For example, the project schedule could be a list of major\nmilestones or a presentation slide. However, as the number of products and work packages increase,\nthe use of specialized tools such as a project scheduling application will make it much easier to\nanalyse and incorporate changes.\n● Novelty If the products or delivery method are new to an organization, it may be difficult to rely on\nexperience or similar projects to capture requirements or estimate schedule and costs. Therefore,\nplans incorporate a high degree of uncertainty and the use of risk mitigating techniques (such as\nprototyping) or an iterative-incremental approach may be justified.\n● Cost Project planning is one of the most prudent ways to reduce the risk of project failure.\nTherefore, it is sensible to ensure that the level of effort in project planning is in line with the overall\ncost of the project. The cost of project planning and support will depend on the importance and\ncomplexity of the project. In some cases, it could be ten percent or more of the overall cost of the\nproject.\nScenario: contrasting scale\nProjects are contextual with different scales of size, risk, and complexity. The\nplanning should reflect these differences in an attempt to apply proportionality\nin the approach.\nThe LouisShopping project is a typical project (to the supplier) of medium\ncomplexity (to the client) and spans three financial years. Therefore, with a larger planning\nhorizon, the project will require a combination of high-level detail (overall project) and low-level\ndetail (stage) when planning. This is to enable sufficient oversight on a day-to-day basis for team\nleaders and the project management team while assuring the project board that the overall\nproject is on track.\nIn contrast, a simpler project with lower complexity and risk that spans six months within the\nsame financial year will be less demanding regarding planning and controls. This can be seen in\nthe new campaign by NowByou. In this instance, it could be sufficient to present a single\ntimeframe (project plan) relating to the entire project.\n7.5 Management products to support the\npractice\nPRINCE2 includes 16 management products that are used to manage the project.

These are typically both derived from the\nuser’s quality expectations and determined by aspects of the business or operational context.\nOperational context could include applicable regulatory requirements or requirements driven by\nexisting policies and practices.\n8.1.2 Product-based quality\nThe principle of focusing on products is central to the PRINCE2 approach to quality. PRINCE2 uses the\nterm requirements to describe the expectations, needs, and desires of a project’s stakeholders for the\nproject products, outcomes, and benefits. No project can ever satisfy all requirements. This is why\nrequirements need to be prioritized and agreed in a controlled manner.\nPRINCE2 provides a product-based approach to requirements that aims to translate requirements into\nacceptance criteria and quality specifications for project products and the activities to deliver them.\nThis helps avoid expending resources on work that cannot be traced back to the project’s business\njustification.\nThe product-based quality management approach ensures clear traceability of quality specifications and\nquality controls to the required products, thereby avoiding conflicts over unmet user quality expectations.\nThe larger the scope and duration of a project, the larger (and more dynamic) the set of requirements\nthe project manager will need to handle. No matter how thoroughly and accurately stakeholder\nrequirements have been captured in product descriptions in the process of initiating a project, the\nproject management team should anticipate requirements changes and be prepared to handle them.\nRequirements management is an ongoing activity that constitutes the first part of the product-based\nquality management approach.\nIt is easier and cheaper to correct quality issues and flaws early in the project lifecycle, rather than when\nthe finished product is being tested or, worse, when the product is already in operational use.\nPrevention of such issues is achieved through quality planning, which also reduces the resources and\nrisks involved in quality control.\n8.2 Guidance for effective quality management\nQuality management focuses on three elements: quality planning, quality control, and quality assurance.\n● Quality planning involves:\n● identifying the major products of the project and documenting them in terms of user’s quality\nexpectations and acceptance criteria in the project product description\n130"

The project product description is also the primary input to quality\nplanning, which aims to create two management products:\n● Product descriptions detailing the quality specifications for each product and associated quality\ntolerances\n● Quality management approach describing the supporting techniques and standards to be\napplied, and the roles and responsibilities for achieving the required quality specifications and\nacceptance criteria.\n8.3.1.1.2 Creating product descriptions\nThe requirements in the project product description are typically stated at a high level and must be\ndeveloped in further detail to enable accurate estimation and planning. It is not unusual for a small\nnumber of user quality expectations in the project product description to be translated into dozens of\nquality specifications in an individual product description.\nOne of the biggest challenges in translating stakeholder requirements into quality specifications is\nachieving consensus on effective measures for product characteristics. For example, it is not enough to\nstate that a new building has to be large enough to house 100 staff. How the building will be used by the\nstaff, the nature of the work they will perform, and the types of support equipment and facilities they\nwill require must be considered and translated into quality specifications.

All of these factors need to be\ncaptured as objective quantitative and qualitative measures:\n● Quantitative measures translating requirements into numeric terms (In the above example, 100\nstaff is a quantitative measure.)\n● Qualitative measures translating requirements into descriptive rather than numeric terms such as\n‘easy to use’. The danger in using qualitative measures is that they can be too vague to assess\nobjectively. For example, easy to use should be clarified by also describing the level of knowledge\nand training of the intended user. It may be useful to distinguish quality specifications in terms of\nfunctional and non-functional requirements:\n● Functional requirements describes how a product must perform and be used\n● Non-functional requirements describes inherent characteristics of the product, such as its\nsecurity or reliability.\nScenario: example non-functional requirement\nFor Data Knowledge’s time-recording solution, a functional requirement is that it\nmust allow the authentication of users who are trying to log in to the app. These\nrequirements define how a system/product must work and/or do. The\nrequirement that the processing of each time record should be done within 10\nseconds is an example of a non-functional requirement to be met by Data Knowledge’s app.\nThese requirements explain how the system/product should perform, including attributes of\nusability, performance, security, and so on.\nAnother way to distinguish functional and non-functional requirements is to associate functional\nrequirements with fitness for purpose and non-functional requirements with fitness for use. If\nthere are constraints on how a product is developed, produced, or delivered, such requirements\nmay also need to be reflected in the associated work package description.\nSubject to the complexity and maturity of the requirements for a product, it may be appropriate\nto keep the product descriptions at a relatively high level in the process of initiating a project. The\nproduct descriptions can be primarily used to establish sufficient confidence in the time and cost\nestimates and confirm that the project can be delivered within an acceptable level of risk. The\nproduct description also identifies the responsible producer, reviewer, and acceptance authority.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n8\n-\nQ\nu\na\nl\ni\nt\ny\n8.3.1.1.3 Describing the quality management approach\nAlthough the quality management approach is often developed in parallel with the initial product\ndescriptions, its content should be aimed at ensuring the delivery of products that meet the user’s\nquality expectations and acceptance criteria. Therefore, it should focus on how quality control will be\norganized, performed, monitored, and reported while providing a concise explanation of how quality\nplanning has occurred.\nThe quality management approach describes the quality standards and procedures that will be\nfollowed, the tools and techniques to be used, the reporting and record keeping arrangements, and the\nroles and responsibilities for the quality management activities.\n137"

The quality planning for this project will need qualified subject\nmatter experts to help develop the quality specifications included in the product\ndescriptions. Additionally, BuildyBrick and Louistown city council have agreed to adopt the latest\nversion of the Mall Federation standards for construction, which include defined criteria to be\nmet by BuildyBrick. The Mall Federation standards are referred to in the quality management\napproach as well as in relevant product descriptions which will refer to specific clauses in the\nstandards. As construction work is completed, numerous types of specialized testing and\ninspection activities will be involved during quality control to confirm compliance with these\nspecifications. The quality management approach should ensure that the necessary experts are\nidentified and available to support both quality planning and quality control.\nConstruction efficiencies and safety concerns mandate the application of high-quality standards\nin the construction industry. LouisShopping will not be an exception regarding the concrete\npavement strength, composition of construction materials, or parking slots measurements.\nWhen approved, the initial product descriptions and the quality management approach become\npart of the project baseline. The product descriptions are recorded in the quality register to allow\nmonitoring and reporting of quality control activities and in the product register to allow\nmonitoring and reporting on product delivery and acceptance.\n8.3.1.2 Controlling quality\nWhen the quality management approach and the initial product descriptions are approved, the focus of\nthe quality practice shifts to quality control. Quality control activities are recorded in the quality register,\nwhich provides information for end stage reports and the end project report.\nThe quality register merely records the quality control activity and its result (typically as ‘pass’ or ‘fail’). If\na product fails a quality control activity such as an inspection or test, and there is an expectation that\nthe product is likely to pass, it may be reasonable to repeat the activity.\nIf a product cannot pass a quality control activity, the failure must be reviewed against quality\ntolerances and quality specifications. Exceptions to quality tolerances and off-specifications are\naddressed using the issue management technique as described in Chapter 10.\nLessons identified in the course of the product quality lifecycle are captured in the project log: lessons\nlog.\n8.3.1.3 Accepting products\nThe individuals or roles responsible for accepting a product are identified in the product description.\nAcceptance usually involves both the review of the product quality control information provided by the\nproject and an independent review of the product against the user’s quality expectations and\nacceptance criteria. Acceptance of a project product typically transfers ownership or responsibility for\nthe product from the project or supplier to the project board on behalf of the user.\n138"

For\nexample, testing at a supplier’s facility can reduce the risk of costs and delays that might be\nencountered at the user’s location.

      "content": "8.4 Applying the practice\n8.4.1 Organizational context\nA starting point of quality planning in an organizational context is to identify whether the business or\nprogramme has a mandated quality management system and expertise to perform quality assurance\nactivities. If more than one organization is involved in a project (for example, separate user and supplier\norganizations), each may have its own quality management system and quality assurance expertise.\nThe roles, responsibilities, and capabilities of each should be reflected in the quality management\napproach.\nWhere the project is part of a programme or portfolio, the quality management approach for the\nprogramme or portfolio will usually determine the quality management approach for the project. In this\ncase, only project-specific approaches will need to be documented in the quality management approach.\nThe project may also be subject to external quality standards, for example, when the project is within a\nregulated environment. These standards may apply to both the project products and the delivery\nactivities and would need to be reflected in the product descriptions and the work package descriptions.\n8.4.2 Commercial context\nIn a commercial context, product descriptions and the quality management approach must consider\nthe function of a contract or other commercial agreement during product delivery. For example, access\nto a supplier’s facility or the ability of the customer’s quality assurance staff to conduct inspections or\nindependent tests should be specified as part of the contract terms. The contract may also need to\nspecify that the supplier provides transparency for its own quality control and reporting.\nAcceptance must be also treated in a contractual and project sense. Acceptance of a product from a\nsupplier may be a prerequisite to acceptance of a product by the customer. However, its terms and\nconditions will be covered under the contract, not the project initiation documentation. Care should be\ntaken to ensure that contractual quality and acceptance criteria do not conflict with those in the\nproduct and project product descriptions.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n8\n-\nQ\nu\na\nl\ni\nt\ny\nScenario: quality responsibilities in contracts\nIn the Louistown Shopping scenario, the construction of the shopping centre\nand parking garage falls under the scope of a contract.

This enables product descriptions and quality specifications to be\ndeveloped in sufficient detail to support scheduling and estimation to a higher level of confidence.\nHowever, this does not mean that there will be no changes in requirements in the course of production\nor delivery. Instead, the sequence of delivery activities is typically designed to allow uncertain aspects of\nproduct requirements and quality specifications to be addressed early, thereby reducing the level of risk\nin later stages.\nIn addition, as with all projects, acceptance criteria and quality specifications may be affected by\nchanges external to a linear-sequential project and addressed through change control. An example of\nsuch an external change would be the introduction of new regulatory requirements for a project\nproduct.\nScenario: example of changes to scope and quality\nThe results of early market testing by Findef uncovered that receiving in-app\npush notifications on product 1 was a feature in high demand by the consulted\nmarket sample, and it is a feature increasingly offered in financial services\nproducts. Findef also learned that a new regulatory reporting requirement for\nfinancial crime has been published. The project manager is going to assess the impact of\nintroducing the new notification feature as a change request to scope and the regulatory\nreporting requirement as a change request to quality standards. These change requests will be\nassessed, and options proposed ahead of the planning of the next project stage.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n8\n-\nQ\nu\na\nl\ni\nt\ny\n8.4.3.2 Iterative-incremental projects\nIn iterative-incremental projects, the quality specifications and acceptance criteria are not fixed with the\napproval of the project initiation documentation. Instead, they are considered goals that are to be\nachieved through iterations of development and delivery, often referred to as sprints.\nIn this case, the project product descriptions may be written in the form of high-level user stories with\nassociated acceptance criteria and can develop iteratively as the project proceeds. As an alternative, the\nrequirements (including quality specifications and acceptance criteria) can be captured and managed in\na product backlog. This is a prioritized list that is reviewed and updated with each iteration. Acceptance\ncriteria are commonly used to ascertain whether a user story has been completed.\nAn agile project may also aim for early delivery of a minimum viable product, a version of the product\nwith just enough features to be usable for the purpose of providing feedback and refining\nrequirements. Developing a product description for the minimum viable product is an effective way of\ndemonstrating PRINCE2 principles with agile delivery. The quality management approach may include a\nstandard ‘definition of done’ and ‘definition of ready’.\n141"

Sustainability\nrequirements should address both the organization’s ability to sustain expected benefits after delivery\n(for example, the sustainability of a product) and its ability to achieve its expectations for the\nenvironmental impacts of the project and its products (environmental sustainability).\nBoth aspects can be addressed at a high level in the project product description. The quality specifications\nassociated with product sustainability can usually be derived from information about the product’s supply\nchain, as well as how the business intends to use and support the product. Quality specifications related to\nenvironmental sustainability may need to reference regulatory or advisory standards.\n8.4.5 Scale\nQuality management always has a cost. The goal of an effective quality management approach is to\noffset the potential costs of product failures by an adequate level of quality planning and control. Overly\nstringent quality specifications and acceptance criteria can dramatically increase the overall cost of a\nproject.\nProjects with a small number of products delivered through well-understood methods may find it\nsufficient to rely on existing standards and inspection at the point of delivery. On the other hand, a project\nthat develops a new product with numerous components or subsystems and involving multi-stage\ndelivery, may need a significant investment in quality control as well as numerous quality reviews.

This uncertainty may arise\nfrom events inside or outside the business. For example, there may be uncertainty from within the\nbusiness about the ability to agree to the scope of the project within certain timescales, or the\navailability of key people and critical resources. There may also be uncertainty from outside the\nbusiness, such as geopolitical events, economic conditions, changes to legislation, or suppliers’\nresponses to procurement requests coming within expected costs.\nDefinition: Risk\nAn uncertain event or set of events that, should they occur, will affect the achievement of\nobjectives. A risk is measured by a combination of the probability of a perceived threat or\nopportunity occurring and the magnitude of its impact on objectives.\nRisks can have a negative or positive impact on objectives if they occur. PRINCE2 uses the terms ‘threat’\nfor uncertain events that would have a negative impact on objectives and ‘opportunity’ for uncertain\nevents that would have a positive impact on objectives.\nThreats and opportunities can impact the project’s objective of delivering an agreed scope and benefits\nto an agreed time, cost, and quality, as well as within agreed sustainability targets.\nAs all projects involve some degree of risk-taking, they need to manage risk in a way that supports\neffective decision-making. The risk practice provides a disciplined environment for proactive decision-\nmaking.\nThe approach used by PRINCE2 to manage risk is aligned with the ISO standard, ISO 31000.

      "content": "9.2.1 Risk planning\nThe use of risk categories helps projects to identify and prioritize risks. Techniques such as PESTLE\n(political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental) analysis and SWOT (strengths,\nweaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis (both described later in this chapter) can be used to\nanalyse the internal and external context for risks. These techniques also help to identify different types\nof risk that may affect the project (for example, sustainability, cybersecurity, or systems integration). An\nunderstanding of the types of risks can also help to identify the most appropriate owners.\nA key item that needs to be recorded in the risk management approach is the project board’s attitude\ntowards risk-taking, documented as the risk tolerance. The risk tolerance will be set by the project board\nbased on the business’ overall risk appetite.\nAn important aspect of identifying risks is the ability to provide a clear and unambiguous expression of\neach risk. A useful way of expressing risk is to consider the following aspects:\n● Risk cause This should describe the source of the risk, such as the event or situation that causes it.\nThese are often referred to as risk drivers. They are not risks in themselves but are potential trigger\npoints for risk. These may be either internal or external to the project.\n● Risk event This should describe the area of uncertainty in terms of the threat or the opportunity.\n● Risk effect This should describe the impact that the risk would have on the project objectives,\nshould the risk materialize.\nThe cause, event, and effect relationship could also be expressed as follows:\n● Threat Insufficient staffing capacity (risk cause) could lead to the business being unable to provide\nenough staff to complete user training in the planned timescales (risk event), resulting in the project\ntaking longer than planned (risk effect).\n● Opportunity If allowable under data regulations, the company could include a discount code in the\nemail (risk event) when it renews customer details every year (risk cause), generating income to offset\nthe cost of the regulatory requirement (risk effect).\n9.2.2 Risk analysis\nRisk analysis can include qualitative and quantitative approaches. Qualitative analysis of a risk includes,\nas a minimum, assessing its probability (the chance that the risk will occur) and its impact (the size of\nthe effect on one or more objectives if the risk occurs). Other qualitative assessments include analysing\na risk’s proximity (how near in time it might occur) and velocity (how quickly it would have an impact on\nobjectives should it occur).\nA useful way of summarizing the set of risks and their estimations is to plot them onto a risk matrix, an\nexample of which is shown in figure 9.1. This represents a situation at a specific point in time (such as a\nsnapshot of the risk environment). The numbered markers in the matrix represent unique risk\nidentifiers used in the risk register on which this is based. The risks above and to the right of the dashed\nrisk tolerance line represent those that the business will not tolerate, except under special\ncircumstances. In the depicted case, the project manager would refer risks 1, 3, and 4 to the project\nboard.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n9\n-\nR\ns\nk\ni\n150"

This can often\nbe achieved by removing the cause of a threat, or by implementing a factor that leads to an\nopportunity. This option may be adopted for no extra cost by changing the way the work is\nplanned. However, often costs will be incurred to remove all residual risk for threats and\nopportunities. Where costs are incurred, they must be justified. For example, it is acceptable\nto discover the cost of a response to make the situation certain.\nTable continues\n151"

      "content": "Response options\nUse\nReduce a threat\nEnhance an opportunity\nTransfer the risk\nShare the risk\nAccept the risk\nPrepare contingent plans\nThis option chooses to take definite action now to change the probability and/or impact of the\nrisk. The term ‘mitigate’ is relevant when discussing reduction of a threat, which involves\nmaking the threat less likely to occur or reducing the impact if it did. Enhancing an opportunity\nis the reverse process, which involves making the opportunity more likely to occur or\nincreasing the impact if it did. Again, because this option commits the business to the costs\nfor reduction or enhancement now, response costs must be justified in terms of the change\nto residual risk.\nThis option aims to impart part of the risk to a third party. Insurance is the most common\nform of transfer, where the insurer accepts the risk cost but the insured retains the impact on\nother objectives (for example, a time delay). The transfer can apply to opportunities, where a\nthird party gains a cost benefit, and the primary risk taker gains another benefit. This is not a\ncommonly used option, whereas transfer of threats is commonly used. Again, the cost of\ntransfer must be justified in terms of the change to residual risk (for example, is the premium\nyou pay worth it?). It is important to note that some elements of risk cannot be transferred,\nalthough the business may choose to delegate the management of the risks to a third party.\nThis option is different in nature from the transfer response, as it seeks for multiple parties,\ntypically within a supply chain, to share the risk on a pain or gain share basis. Risks can rarely\nbe entirely shared in this way. For example, the primary risk taker will always need to protect\ntheir brand and reputation, but this can be a successful way of encouraging collaboration on\nrisk management activities, particularly in programmes and projects.\nThis option means that the business ‘takes the chance’ that the risk will occur, managing its full\nimpact if it did. There is no change to residual risk with the accept option, but neither are any\ncosts incurred now, to manage the risk or to prepare to manage the risk in future. An example\nwould be the risk to profitability because of currency fluctuations. The business may decide to\ntake the chance and not engage in any hedging or other provisions to protect margins from\nwide variation in rates. This option would not be appropriate if the risk exposure exceeded the\nrisk tolerance threshold for the activity in question.\nNote that in a case such as currency fluctuations, where the impact could be positive or\nnegative, this counts as two risks because a risk is the relationship between the uncertain\nevent and the impact of that event. There is a risk leading to loss and another leading to gain,\nso framing the uncertainty as two risks allows for different responses to each.\nThis option involves preparing plans but waiting to take action. It is most usually associated\nwith the ‘accept’ option. The preparation of contingent plans suggests that the risks are\naccepted for now, but a plan will be made for what should be done if the situation changes.\nThis option applies equally to other responses and is often referred to as a fallback plan,\nwhich is the plan if the original response does not work. Fallback plans apply to all other\nstrategies, including avoiding a threat and exploiting an opportunity, because the plan to\navoid or exploit may not be successful despite good intentions.\nIf a threat is reduced rather than removed, the largest realistic probability or size of impact of the risk\nthat remains is called the ‘residual’ risk. If the residual risk is significant, then it may be appropriate to\nselect more than one risk response.\nIn some cases, implementing a risk response will reduce or remove other related risks. It is also\npossible that the responses to risks will change some aspect of the project after they have been\nimplemented. Consequently, this may lead to secondary risks (risks that occur as a result of invoking a\nrisk response). It is essential that these are identified, assessed, and controlled in the same way as the\ninitially identified risk.\nIt is important that risk responses balance the cost of implementing the response against the\nprobability and impact of allowing the risk to occur. One way to assess this is to compare the cost of the\nrisk response with the difference in the expected monetary value of the risk. This is the product of the\nestimated most likely financial impact of a risk and its estimated probability, both before and after the\nrisk response. If the cost of the risk response is lower than the reduction in the expected monetary\nvalue, then it is usually worth undertaking the risk response. However, it is always worth remembering\nthe overall effect of all risk response activities on the project team, as it may move their focus away from\ndelivering the project to risk response actions.\n152\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n9\n-\nR\ns\nk\ni"

Decision bias is natural and largely positive, allowing the brain to\nefficiently make rapid decisions every day.\nHowever, sometimes decision bias can result in less effective decision-making. There are many types of\nbias, for example:\n● Optimism bias A mindset that drives people to discount disadvantageous risk, on the assumption\nthat things are likely to be successful for them.\n● Loss aversion A mindset that values the avoidance of loss rather than making a gain.\n● Groupthink A mindset that makes people value social cohesion in a group more than expressing an\nalternative point of view or reaching the right decision.\n● Proximity A mindset where situations that are closer in time are seen as riskier and more important\nthan those in the future.\nUnderstanding and overcoming these are important considerations when identifying risks and potential\nresponses.\nScenario: culture example\nThe transformational nature of the projects that form the FindefTwo programme\nand the business risks involved require a different attitude to risk compared with\nthe normal day-to-day activities at Findef.\nThe programme manager knows that if they want to make risk management\nwork, they must establish the conditions for success within the leadership team.

To help achieve\nthis, an assessment tool such as the Agilometer in PRINCE2 Agile can be used to answer the question,\n‘how agile can we be on this project?’.\n9.4.3 Delivery method\nThe approach to managing risk needs to work with and support the project’s chosen delivery method.\nFor example, a risk management approach that includes monthly risk review meetings will struggle to\nsupport an iterative-incremental delivery method with two-week sprints.\nThe PRINCE2 method does not require a particular format for risk management products, nor specific\ntimings for risk management activities. What is important is that they are appropriate for the format and\npace of the project. For example, in an agile delivery method, risks in a risk register may be written on a\nwhiteboard and reviewed as part of a daily stand-up meeting. In this context, this manual approach may\nbe just as valid as using a specialized IT system to capture and review risks.\nIt is also important to recognize that the project’s delivery method might work to mitigate or reinforce\nspecific risks. For example, an agile way of working inherently ensures that users do not overspecify\nrequirements at the beginning of a project, which can be a risk in a more linear approach.\nAlthough agile is characterized by a high level of engagement with the users directly involved in the\nproject, if not managed correctly, it can lead to uncontrolled changes to the agreed baseline. Linear\napproaches tend to reinforce the impression of ‘controlled change’ but can appear unresponsive and\nalienate users. It is of importance that the risk management approach recognizes these inherent\ndifferences.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n9\n-\nR\ns\nk\ni\n9.4.4 Sustainability\nA project will have specific sustainability targets and tolerances incorporated into its business case.\nThese should be assessed for risks. Risk management considerations related to sustainability can\ninclude:\n● defining the approach to managing risks relating to sustainability of the project work (for example,\nthe project not meeting its sustainability performance targets)\n● defining the approach to managing risks relating to the sustainability of the project product, (for\nexample, one or more products not meeting their sustainability performance requirements)\n● incorporating the cost of responding to sustainability risks into the risk budget (for example, extreme\nweather events that may affect the project or the resilience of the supply chain)\n● documenting specific risks and actions relating to sustainability into the risk register and including\nthem in regular risk communications.\n161"

      "content": "9.4.5 Scale\nIt is important to ensure that the risk management approach is appropriate for the project’s size, scale,\nand complexity as well as for the project’s likely risk impact. Project scale and impact need to be\nconsidered separately. For example, a small-scale project to replace an element of a business’ IT\nnetwork infrastructure could stop the whole business if it goes wrong. It is possible for projects to\ncreate impacts that far outweigh their apparent size, scale, and complexity.\nIt is important that the risk management approach supports effective decision-making in the project\nand does not create an undue burden or bureaucracy. In general, smaller, simpler projects will need\ncorrespondingly simpler risk management arrangements, and larger, more complex projects will need\nmore thorough controls. For example, in a simple project, the project manager would typically directly\nundertake most risk management activities. However, in more complex projects these activities might\nbe delegated to a dedicated risk manager or risk management team. Similarly, risks might be held in a\nsimple list on a whiteboard, in a spreadsheet, or in a dedicated system. It is important to ensure that\nthe approach to risk management is appropriate and understood by everyone involved in the project.\nThe risk budget is based on the aggregate cost of all the project’s planned risk responses. For simpler\nprojects, it will usually be enough to combine the cost of all risk responses. However, for more complex\nprojects, care needs to be taken so that the aggregation of the factored costs is not skewed by a small\nnumber of large risks.\n9.5 Management products to support the\npractice\nPRINCE2 includes 16 management products that are used to manage the project.

Change is not something to avoid. All\nprojects encounter changes, and they must be addressed, not ignored. The key is to handle changes in\na responsive but controlled way.\n10.2 Guidance for effective issue management\nThe PRINCE2 issue management approach comprises:\n● Baselines describes what is subject to change control\n● Issue resolution how issues are identified, captured, assessed, and recommended for resolution\n● Change control describes how changes to the project baseline are controlled\n● Delegating authority for changes allocating authority from the project board down to enable a\nresponsive but controlled way to handle changes\n● Change budget the money set aside in a plan to cover changes.\n10.2.1 Baselines\nChange can only be assessed in terms of its impact on the project as understood and approved by the\nproject board. At any stage in its lifecycle, the project will comprise a set of management and specialist\nproducts. At any point in time, each product is either in preparation, development, or has been\napproved. In all cases they will be under change control.\nA prerequisite to effective issue management and change control is a way of creating baselines of\nproducts that allow changes to be analysed and controlled. A new version of the product is created\neach time a change is approved and implemented. Change control enables those involved to identify\nwhen changes have been made and to trace them to a decision made by the appropriate authority.\nThe issue management approach for a project is driven by the nature of the products to be delivered\n(the ‘what’) and the planned delivery activities (the ‘how’). Therefore, the preparation of this approach\nusually follows the preparation of product descriptions and work package descriptions.\nRegardless of size, scale, and complexity, the project management team needs to determine:\n● The appropriate level at which the products need to be baselined\n● this is generally determined by dividing the project products until they reach the level at which a\ncomponent can be independently released, installed, replaced, or modified\n● the level of control exercised will be influenced by the importance of the project and the\ncomplexity of the relationships between its products.\n169\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n1\n0\n-\nI\ns\ns\nu\ne\ns"

This usually occurs through reviews or audits and is\ntypically undertaken at the end of each stage and at the end of the project.\nProject baselines are often managed with a variety of systems. Management products may be\nmaintained as documents with a simple way of indicating each version and its date of approval.\nSpecialist products may require a dedicated system. However, each system should ensure that changes\ncannot be introduced without the appropriate level of approval and provide an audit trail for all\nchanges. In addition, the product register element of the project log should record the approval and\nimplementation of all changes to the project baseline.\n10.2.2 Issue resolution\nPRINCE2 recommends that all issues are categorized as either:\n● a problem or concern\n● an event external to the project\n● a business opportunity\n● a request for change\n● off-specification.\nThis assists the assessment and also provides valuable data on the type of issues that are repeatedly\nbeing raised which can indicate another aspect of project management is not working. It is good\npractice when assessing categorizing issues to check whether the issue is actually a risk. The distinction\nis that risks are uncertain. If this is the case the issue should be transferred to the risk register and the\nprocedure in the risk management approach should be followed. Similarly, it is good practice to review\nand check whether the risk register includes any entries which are not uncertain and therefore should\nbe managed as an issue.\nDefinition: Problem or concern\nA problem is an issue with an immediate and negative impact.\nA concern is an issue whose timeliness and impact need to be assessed.\nOften, issues are first presented informally in conversations or communications among project team\nmembers.

On the other hand, project managers should avoid filtering or\nprejudging problems and concerns. It is most effective to identify issues early when they can generally\nbe resolved within approved tolerances.\nIn some cases, the issue is an event external to the project that may impact the project in some way.\nFor example, a supplier going out of business is outside the project’s control, but it may force the\nproject management team to analyse the resulting impacts and consider finding an alternative supplier.\nThis is why it is always advised to monitor the project’s external environment on a regular basis.\nScenario: formal versus informal issues\nIn the LouisShopping project, BuildyBrick, the main contractor, did not complete\nthe water storage tank installation as per the floor plan, as it was difficult to\nintegrate the infrastructure with an old pipe uncovered by excavations. As this is\noff-specification, it needs to be handled formally, and the project manager has\nentered it in the issue register and that a printed report needs to be issued to the council the\nfollowing week.

In some cases, an issue occurs that represents a business\nopportunity with positive consequences. For example, significant savings in the cost of goods or\nservices, or the availability of new equipment with improved functionality. The consequences of such\nbusiness opportunities are not always limited to a project, so it can be useful to seek the advice of the\nproject board when preparing the assessment of impacts and possible resolutions.\nIssues should be recorded in the issue register. For some issues, the details captured in the issue\nregister are sufficient for the issue to be considered and an action agreed. However, some issues may\nrequire more detailed analysis and an issue report will be created.

The issue\nmanagement approach describes the project’s change control procedure, including how proposals to\nchange the project baseline will be recorded and decided.\nPRINCE2 characterizes proposals to change a project baseline as either a request for change or off-\nspecification.\nA request for change must identify the management products proposed to be changed and provide a\njustification for making the change. If there is a cost associated with the change, the source of its funding\nmust be identified as either the approved change budget or additional funding.\nOff-specifications most often occur when a supplier fails to deliver a product that fully complies with its\nquality specifications. However, off-specification can also occur when a required quality specification is\nfound to be unachievable. In either case, it represents a discrepancy between the approved project\nbaseline and the delivered products, and this discrepancy must be addressed through the change\ncontrol procedure.\nIf the off-specification is accepted, the project baseline must be changed to reflect the affected product\ndescription. Accepted off-specifications are known as concessions and require project board approval,\nor approval by those with delegated change authority. If the off-specification is rejected, the team\nmanager in consultation with the project manager will need to explore how to correct the situation,\nincluding through possible use of the change budget or raising an exception report (see Chapter 11).\nIf an issue requires a request for a change or off-specification, the issue report should include the\ndetails of the proposed changes to enable timely decision-making.\nScenario: example of off-specification\nIn the LouisShopping scenario, if it was determined that the number of spaces in\nthe parking garage was inadequate for the anticipated demand, it would be\nnecessary to identify not only the cost of increasing capacity, but also how this\nchange might be funded.\nIn some cases, an issue is raised because a product does not or will not meet its quality\nspecifications. This is referred to as off-specification. In the LouisShopping scenario, if it was\ndetermined that the construction contractor had failed to provide the required number of\nparking spaces, this would be considered off-specification.\n172"

If there is too little\ndelegation, the project board is likely to slow the progress or be asked to review changes that others are\nbetter able to decide. Whereas, if there is too much delegation, particularly to too many different roles,\nthere is an increased risk that the overall benefits of the project will be reduced as alignment with the\nbusiness justification is diluted.\nIn a project where few changes are envisaged, it may be reasonable to leave this authority in the hands\nof the project board. However, for projects where there are likely to be many changes, the project board\nmay choose to delegate some decisions.\nIn practice, most changes will be generated at the work package level. It is important to ensure that\nthere is sufficient delegated authority to approve the changes for the work packages. In this way,\nchanges can be made without always having to escalate decisions to the project board for approval.\nSubject to the scale and complexity of the project, it may be useful to delegate change authority to\nseveral levels within the project management team.

An IT analyst was called to identify the problem and\nrealized that the hard disk used for taking backups was broken and will require\nfull replacement. This is a problem/concern that can be handled immediately by the project\nmanager without adding significant cost to the project. Therefore, it does not need to be\nregistered in the issue register but can be recorded in the daily log.\nLater in the project, the project board requests that the logotype displayed in the new\ncybersecurity product be changed to reflect the corporate logotype that has been recently\napproved. This represents a change request which, although simple to accommodate and within\nthe tolerance levels of the project manager, needs to be handled formally and recorded in the\nproject issue register.\n174"

Instead, it\nhas to be answered within the context of project tolerances and priorities. A project with tightly limited\ntolerances may need to restrict the types of issues it considers. On the other hand, some issues are\npurely informational or advisory, such as a change in working hours that does not result in an\nacceleration or delay in delivery activities.\nMajor issues or potential changes to the project baseline require an integrated assessment that\nconsiders them in the context of impacts on the overall project plan. The seven types of tolerances\nrepresent interrelated aspects of a project, and major issues and changes rarely affect only one aspect.\nTherefore, the assessment should consider the impact of an issue or change on:\n● the approved targets and tolerances\n● the project business case\n● other products or work packages.\nWhen possible, project managers should aim to offer the project board more than one way to respond\nto an issue or change. It is often possible to make trade-offs or concessions among requirements or\ntolerances, such as obtaining better performance from a product in return to allowing a delay in its\ndelivery. Although all issues should be assessed, not all will necessitate a change. To reject it and do\nnothing can be a valid response to an issue.\nThe assessment of issues and the development of ways to resolve them is best approached in a\ncooperative manner by gathering inputs and ideas from a variety of project team members and\nstakeholders. This is particularly true when the issue has impacts and response options outside the\nscope of the project itself.\nIt may be useful to seek the advice of the project board to confirm its understanding of an issue’s\npriority or severity before completing the assessment and proposing options.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n1\n0\n-\nI\ns\ns\nu\ne\ns\n10.3.1.3 Recommending resolution\nBased on the assessment, a recommendation is made to the appropriate person or group who has the\nrequired authority.

Examples include:\n● Root cause analysis deconstructs a problem into its contributing causes with the aim of\ndistinguishing one or more primary causes from other secondary or derivative ones.\n● Pareto analysis collects possible causes and identifies the most likely ones using the 80/20 rule,\nalso known as the Pareto principle, which asserts that 80 percent of outcomes result from 20\npercent of all causes.\n● This is useful when multiple causes exist and no single one is the obvious source.\n● Cause and effect analysis sorts possible causes into various categories that diverge from the\noriginal problem, with the aim of identifying the most significant factors.\n● This analysis is sometimes performed using a fishbone or Ishikawa diagram.\n● Failure mode analysis a step-by-step approach for identifying all possible failures in a product or\nprocess and assessing the consequences of each.\n● This usually requires some form of the product, either interim form (such as a prototype) or final\nform to exist.\n● Five whys uses a series of questions (such as ‘why did this happen?’) to investigate successive layers\nof a problem.\n● The answer to each question becomes the basis of the next ‘why?’ question. This is a simple tool\nthat is useful when detailed statistics are not needed or available.\nTo be effective, problem-solving techniques must be applied systematically. A team effort is typically\nrequired.\n10.4 Applying the practice\n10.4.1 Organizational context\nThe project manager should determine whether there are any organizational or external policies,\nstandards, and procedures that must be applied and incorporate them into the project’s own issue\nmanagement approach.\nIf the project is within a programme or portfolio, there may be a requirement that the project uses their\ndefined policies and procedures. Many programmes employ a common issue management capability,\nas well as change control systems that projects must use. The programme or portfolio may also have\nrequirements on how issues are assessed and guidance on issues that need to be raised to their level.\n10.4.2 Commercial context\nIn a commercial environment, the project may be required to adopt change control procedures defined\nin the contract. Suppliers will often have their own issue management approach and change control\nsystem. If a supplier is required to participate in the project’s issue management approach, use its issue\nregister or change control tools. This needs to be specified within the applicable contract or agreement.\n177\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n1\n0\n-\nI\ns\ns\nu\ne\ns"

      "content": "Scenario: collaborative approach to issue management\nThe incomplete state of the water storage tank installation in the LouisShopping\nproject triggered off-specification to be managed by the project management\nteam. The project board is sympathetic to the fact that the shopping centre is\nbeing constructed in an unusual setting, where historical findings are a risk to\nthe excavation works. However, a water reserve station is a must-have requirement concerning\nhealth and safety and therefore must be addressed immediately.\nBuildyBrick is interested in establishing a relationship of partnership and trust with the LouisTown\nCouncil, as a successful project can be used as a case study and reference site for prospective\nbusiness. Consequently, a collaborative approach has been agreed to resolve this issue. Despite\nleading to additional construction cost to the project, BuildyBrick will complete the water storage\ntank installation and has agreed to absorb that cost directly rather than request additional\nfunding for completion. The project board has agreed to the additional time required to resolve\nthe tank installation issue without issuing any penalties on BuildyBrick for the delay.\n10.4.3 Delivery method\n10.4.3.1 Linear-sequential projects\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n1\n0\n-\nI\ns\ns\nu\ne\ns\nA key assumption underlying the choice of a linear-sequential approach to a project is that the number\nand magnitude of changes will be reduced as the project lifecycle progresses. This is because it is\ngenerally much easier and less costly to make changes to the project baseline early in the project. For\nexample, changing the size of a room in a construction project may be a trivial matter when the building\nis being designed but costly and time consuming when the building is nearly complete.\nFor this reason, the issue management approach may propose tailoring tolerances to allow flexibility in\nearly stages, such as during design, when the impact of changes may be relatively small. Then, in later\nstages, such as during construction, the tolerances may be much more tightly restricted and a larger\nportion of the change budget made available, in recognition of the potential cost of even minor changes.\nScenario: speed of assessing issues\nAfter learning about the incomplete state of the water storage tank installation in\nthe LouisShopping project, the project manager decides to assess any\ndependencies other products in the project have on the water storage tank.\nThey will assess the project performance targets overall and, if necessary, also\nthe project business case. They discover that although the storage tank is not on the critical path,\nit would cause a delay of more than two weeks, which would lead to a delay to the overall project.\nThe project manager immediately escalates the issue to the project board, who agree to release\nadditional funding for one of the project manager’s recommendations. If there was an incomplete\nor slow assessment of the issue by the project manager and/or a delay in escalating it to the\nproject board., it would have been too late to implement the recommended remedy. This would\nhave caused a domino effect of delays and additional costs.\n178"

      "content": "Issues\n10.4.3.2 Iterative-incremental projects\nIssue management and change control are intrinsic to the iterative-incremental approach. The frequent\nreview of progress and short cycles of delivery work (such as in agile methodologies) are intended to\nraise and resolve issues quickly. This is to allow the scope baseline (sometimes referred to as the\nproduct backlog) to evolve in a manner that keeps a close alignment between requirements and\ndeveloped capabilities of the product.\nIf the entire scope of the project’s delivery activities follows an incremental-iterative approach, it may be\nsufficient for the project manager to ensure that issues are consistently captured, assessed, and\ndecided. This would be in a manner that provides traceability back to the project product description\nand maintains an effective level of control.\nIn other cases, the project manager should consider structuring the issue management approach to\nallow the project board to retain change authority over management products. Meanwhile, delegating\nauthority over changes in features and functionality in specialist products to the teams working within a\nframework such as PRINCE2 Agile. The issue management approach may include the agile technique of\ntrading/swapping features in response to issues as a means of remaining within tolerance.\nAgile methods enable change late in the product development lifecycle to deliver a product that better\nmatches user expectations with the biggest possible value. This philosophy applies when products are\ndifficult to define in detail early in the project.\n10.4.4 Sustainability\nSustainability can be a source of significant issues and changes from outside the project, particularly in\nthe areas of regulatory requirements and supplier capabilities. If sustainability and environment\nimpacts are a major aspect of the project, the issue management approach should ensure that\nsomeone in the project management team is tasked with the responsibility to monitor external sources\nof potential issues and changes.\n10.4.5 Scale\nThe project manager should consider the following in developing the issue management approach:\n● The scale of the project and the number or diversity of stakeholders On a small project, the\nproject manager may be able to manage issues and changes without support, whereas on a larger\nproject, issue management and change control may justify dedicated support.\n● The products to be delivered and the degree of uncertainty or volatility in their quality\nspecifications If the product descriptions and the understanding of the activities involved in\ndelivering them are mature and well-understood, it is less likely that issues and changes will arise\nfrequently and in a large number. If the project products and delivery method are novel or the set of\nproducts to be delivered are complex, it is likely that issue management and change control will\nrequire a significant level of effort.\n● The characteristics of the project change control tools and associated data Some projects,\nsuch as software development, may be supported by a tool that allows issue management and\nchange control to be supported in a single integrated environment.\n● The sensitivity of issues and the project baseline Project teams whose scope may involve\ndis-benefits or outcomes that may be perceived as negative by some stakeholders may want to\nexercise strong control over access to its issue register.\n179\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n1\n0\n-\nI\ns\ns\nu\ne\ns"

A smaller tolerance has been\nassigned to the variable of time, where the project has been given a tolerance of ±1 month only.\nShould the project forecast to be more than one month early or late compared to the target\nlaunch date for each product, then the project board would need to escalate this deviation to the\nprogramme board.\n11.2.2 Types of control\nEffective project control is delivered through the accurate, timely, and regular measurement of actual\nprogress and comparing it with the planned progress at that stated point in the project or stage and\ntaking any necessary corrective action.\nThe PRINCE2 method provides two types of progress control throughout the life of a project: event-\ndriven controls and time-driven controls.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n1\n1\n-\nP\nr\no\ng\nr\ne\ns\ns\nDefinitions\nEvent-driven control A control that occurs when a specific event occurs. For example, this\ncould be the end of a stage, the completion of the project initiation documentation, or the\ncreation of an exception report. It could also include organizational events that may affect the\nproject, such as the end of the financial year.\nTime-driven control A management control that occurs at predefined periodic intervals. For\nexample, this could be producing highlight reports for the project board or checkpoint\nreports showing the progress of a work package.\nMonitoring is a time-based activity, control (decision-making) is an event-based activity, and reporting is\nboth time-based and event-based. The use of event-driven controls drives efficiency as it means project\nmanagement team do not meet unnecessarily or too frequently, but when most needed.\n11.2.3 Reviewing progress and lessons\nAs part of the controlling a stage process, the project manager will regularly review progress through\ncheckpoint reports and will maintain the project log. The project manager will use this information to\nupdate the stage plan with the actual progress achieved. The format and frequency of checkpoint\nreporting will depend on the needs of individual work packages. It is only possible to control progress at\nthe level of detail in the plans. For example, if weekly checkpoint reports are required, the stage plan will\nhave to include what needs to be achieved week by week.\n190"

However, the issue register may reveal an increasing number of issues that are not\nbeing resolved and may be a cause for concern. Similarly, the quality register may reveal there are a\nnumber of products that have failed a test and not yet been recorded as having been re-tested in the\nquality register.\nActions may arise from many sources and small actions may simply be recorded on the daily log and\nmarked when completed. The daily log can also be used to record informal issues and any other notes\nor observations that are not captured by any other management product.\nThe difference between a formal issue and an informal issue is that a formal issue will be captured in\nthe issue register as an open forum. There, it will then be monitored and reviewed due to its material\nimpact on the project or stage. An informal issue is one that either does not have a material impact or\nrequires handling in a suitable manner where open access would be inappropriate. The daily log is a\nuseful way of recording individual observations that on their own may seem insignificant but when\ncollated may alert the project manager to a new issue or risk.\nThe product register also provides data on the status of the products that are complete, currently in\nprogress, and those awaiting development. The data from this register may be compared with the\nphysical status of the products to provide assurance on the progress of the project.\nA principle of a PRINCE2 project is that the project management team learns from experience.\nTherefore, the project team actively seeks, records, and incorporates relevant lessons throughout the\nlife of the project, applies them to the remaining work and shares them for future projects. It is often in\nthe reviewing of progress that lessons are identified. The project log includes a lessons log, which is\nused for capturing lessons and is accessed when reviewing progress.\nDefinition: Lesson\nA lesson is information to facilitate the future of the project or other projects and actively\npromote learning from experience. The experience may be positive, as in a successful test or\noutcome, or negative, as in a mishap or failure.\nTo record lessons during a project is good for the organization, project team, and other existing and\nfuture projects. Lessons are the documented information that reflect both the positive and negative\nexperiences of a project. Lessons can be captured:\n● during a post-project review\n● during any meetings throughout the project (you do not have to wait until a post-project review to\nshare lessons)\n● via PRINCE2 management products like checkpoint reports or highlight reports\n● by performing retrospectives\n● when issues occur\n● during stakeholder one-to-one meetings\n● using electronic workspaces where data and information are shared.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n1\n1\n-\nP\nr\no\ng\nr\ne\ns\ns\n191"

The project manager gathered the relevant project team members to\ninvestigate how incorrect drawings were shared and to understand what changes were needed to\nprevent the issue from happening again. In this way, they ensured that the issue was not repeated.\nThe project manager also asked for an audit of all floor plans that have been issued for other\nparts of the project to prevent outdated information from being used. The team identified three\nother cases of incorrect drawings and were able to rectify them before any other delays or rework\nwas caused.

Again, the data may be held in an\nintegrated system, which may also allow for ‘what if’ scenario forecasting, to ease the forecasting\nworkload for project managers.\nThe digital and data management approach will describe what systems and data will be used by the\nproject to assist with forecasting.

Project data may be in the form of project documentation, correspondence, project\nlog, and records. It includes both internal and external data, as well as digital and non-digital formats.\nThe collection of data within projects has evolved dramatically with the introduction of digital\ntechnology to plan and schedule projects.

Data analytics is the means of using and\nanalysing data to support effective decision-making or to bring efficiency through the automation of\ntasks.\nProgress reviews are not confined to looking backwards. After having secured and stored the data\nthrough systems, past performance can be used to predict future performance. To ensure clarity, this\ninformation can then be presented in the stakeholders’ preferred format and style.\nThe project management team must decide what they require from the reporting and forecasting\nprocedures. Then, they should select a solution to fit both the requirements and the level of maturity of\nthe business and the organizations that are involved in the project. The business may already have\nestablished systems through a centralized programme or project office. Or the nature of the project\nmay require new systems to be designed, (possibly) procured, and established. For example, the use of\ndigital twins and building information modelling (BIM) in construction projects.\nThe project’s digital and data management approach will explain what digital technology will be used to\nsupport project management and project work as well as how the data will be used and which systems\nwill be used for data analytics. For example, the use of sentiment analysis to understand team\nperformance or stakeholder engagement.\nThe management products used for checking the baselines, reviewing progress, capturing, and\nreporting lessons, reporting progress, or forecasting are frequently recognized by the project manager\nas a combination of disparate sources. Automation, for example the use of artificial intelligence, is\nremoving the need for a manual approach, enabling project professionals to focus on far more value-\nadded tasks rather than administration.\nDue to home working and globalization, project teams are more likely to be distributed across multiple\nlocations rather than co-located. Therefore, the use of digital systems can help to communicate and\ntransfer data or information. If the team and the data are up-to-date, information management is more\nreliable and easier to administer in an automated system.\n195\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n1\n1\n-\nP\nr\no\ng\nr\ne\ns\ns"

      "content": "11.4 Applying the progress practice\n11.4.1 Organizational context\nA starting point for any project will be to identify the timing of the business layer governance\narrangements from which the project will require decisions or authority. It is usually advisable to design\nthe project’s progress controls to align with business layer timings.\nIf the project is part of a programme or portfolio, then the programme or portfolio will usually dictate\nthe progress controls for the project. This will typically include defining common controls, procedures,\ntolerances, and timings.\n11.4.2 Commercial context\nPRINCE2 is based on a customer/supplier environment. It assumes that there will be a customer who\nwill specify the desired result and (usually) pay for the project, and a supplier who will provide the\nresources and skills to deliver that result. Additional considerations apply if the relationship between\nthe customer and the supplier is a commercial one.\nThe contract between the parties acts as a constraint on a project manager’s or team manager’s degree\nof freedom when managing the project or work package. For this reason, it is good practice to ensure\nthat contracts reflect and promote good working relations rather than inhibiting them and that any\ntailoring to PRINCE2 respects the parties’ contract obligations.\nFrom a supplier’s perspective, the project lifecycle should be defined to consider pre-contract activities,\nsuch as qualification, designing and costing the solution, bidding, and negotiation. It may also consider\nactivities at the end of the project, such as warranty and maintenance periods.\n11.4.3 Delivery method\nIt is important that the approach to managing progress works with, and supports, the project’s chosen\ndelivery method rather than going against it.\nFor a project using an iterative-incremental delivery method, it will typically be more appropriate to\nfocus on tracking how much of the requirement is being met by the end of the sprint rather than how\nlong it will take to complete the products. The tolerances would have been set in accordance with this.\nThe frequent delivery of products that meet their acceptance and quality specifications is a primary\nsource of progress information and provides the basis for forecasting future progress.\nThe formality of reporting may differ in an iterative-incremental project using agile techniques such as\nKanban and burn-down or burn-up charts. Checkpoint reporting may be based on a ‘pull’ system,\nwhere the project manager reviews the charts maintained by the development teams rather than being\nsent by them.\nBy contrast, for a project using a linear-sequential delivery method, the focus may be on when the\nstage’s products will be complete and for what costs. In this way, the project board can be confident\nthat there is a robust basis to move from the current stage to the next.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n1\n1\n-\nP\nr\no\ng\nr\ne\ns\ns\n202"

This is to check that the\nproject remains within its sustainability tolerances and the parameters established by the business\nlayer.\nSome areas of sustainability will fall under legislation, regulation, or business layer policies. Therefore, it\nwill require evidence to support compliance. Progress management must be able to identify and report\non the data required to support this evidence.\nThe project executive may request an audit of the project if compliance against sustainability\nregulations is required. Advice should be sought from the quality assurance function with the business\nor programme.\nSustainability reporting should not be separate from the agreed reporting requirements but rather\nintegrated into the cyclical analysis of the project data by the project manager, team managers, and\nproject support. The activities in the plans should consider the data needed to satisfy sustainability\nanalysis, just as they should for the other tolerances within the project. This is so that evidential\nreporting on sustainability is a consequence of progress management and not something that requires\nadditional activities or resource.\n11.4.5 Scale\nProgress management needs to be applied or tailored to reflect the needs of the project’s scale, risk,\ncomplexity, and prominence. In simple projects where risk and complexity are minimal, the progress\npractice may lend itself to some simplified data analysis for reporting and forecasting purposes. Some\nof the roles may have been combined with a project executive sponsoring the project without a project\nboard. The style may be more relaxed, and this could lead the project manager to report progress in a\nstructured email rather than a formal report, for example.\nFor simple projects, questions that may be asked are:\n● Do all the management products need to be used?\n● Could some of the management products be combined?\n● Could the data be distributed in a more effective and efficient manner?\n● Could access to the data be given to stakeholders in accordance with the digital and data\nmanagement approach?\nAs the projects become more complex and attract more risk, the project business may include more\nstakeholders with different reporting requirements. Under these circumstances, a more formal\napproach to evaluation and reporting, either through structured reports or through the use of data and\nsystems, will be required to satisfy the stakeholder requirements.\nThe project executive or project board must agree on the frequency of reporting and have the project\nmanager record their requirements in the project initiation documentation.\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n1\n1\n-\nP\nr\no\ng\nr\ne\ns\ns\n203"

The trigger for the project (which may come in\na wide range of ways) in PRINCE2 is called a project mandate. The project mandate is provided by the\nbusiness, (the organization commissioning the project) and can vary in form from a verbal instruction to\na well-defined and justified project definition.\nBefore formally starting a project, it is important to assess and confirm that it is worthwhile and viable.\nThis is done in the process of starting up a project (see Chapter 13), in which the project manager and\nproject board are appointed, and a project brief and a stage plan for the initiation stage are created.\nThe decision to proceed with project initiation is taken by the project board using their own process of\ndirecting a project (see Chapter 14). The project board then reviews the project brief and stage plan and\ndecides whether and how to initiate the project and allocate the people and resources required.\n12.1.2 Initiation stage\nWhen a decision has been made to proceed with the project, it needs to be planned at an appropriate\nlevel of detail. The planning, establishment of the project management approaches and controls,\ndevelopment of a robust business case, and a means of reviewing benefits are covered by the process\nof initiating a project (see Chapter 15). Also, during the initiation stage, the process of managing a stage\nboundary (see Chapter 18) is used to plan the next stage in detail.\nThe initiation stage ends with the project initiation documentation being reviewed by the project board,\nagain using their own process (directing a project) to decide whether to authorize the project and the next\nstage to proceed. The contents of the project initiation documentation are likely to change throughout the\nproject (under change control), so this version is preserved as the original baseline for later reviews.\n12.1.3 Subsequent stages\nThe project board delegates day-to-day control to the project manager on a stage-by-stage basis. The\nproject manager needs to ensure that progress is in line with the approved plan and that forecasts for\nthe project are within agreed tolerances. The project manager informs the project board of progress\nthrough regular highlight reports. The activities to control each stage are covered by the process of\ncontrolling a stage (see Chapter 16).\nThe project manager needs to assign work to be done to the team managers or members, who execute\nassigned work packages. They, in turn, keep the project manager informed of progress through\ncheckpoint reports. This work is covered by the process of managing product delivery (see Chapter 17).\nTowards the end of each stage, the project manager requests permission to proceed to the next stage\nby reporting how the current stage performed, provides an update to the business case, and plans the\nnext stage in detail. The project manager provides the information needed by the project board to\nassess the continuing viability of the project and to make a decision to authorize the next stage. At all\ntimes, the project board must ensure the project remains aligned with the business strategy. The\nactivities to manage each stage boundary are covered in the process of managing a stage boundary\n(see Chapter 18).\n215"

The project board now needs to be satisfied that the recipients of\neach product are in a position to own and use them on an ongoing basis and that the business is able to\ntake overall ownership of the project product. Should this be the case, the project can close. The project\ndocumentation should be archived, the project assessed for performance against its original plan, and\nthe people and resources assigned to the project need to be released. Closure activities include\nconfirming or revising the plans for the planning post-project benefits reviews to occur for those\nbenefits that can only be assessed after the project product has been in use (and therefore after the\nproject has closed).\n12.1.5 Post-project\nEven though some benefits may be realized during the project, in most cases, many or all of the\nbenefits will be realized after the project is completed. It is therefore likely that one or more post-\nproject benefits reviews will occur. The project’s benefits management approach will document how\nand when these reviews should occur and who is responsible and accountable for them.\n12.2 The PRINCE2 process model\nThe PRINCE2 process model is shown in figure 12.2. The processes are aligned with the management\nlevels of business layer, directing, managing, and delivering. The triggers between the processes are\nshown.\n216"

Nothing should be done until fundamental information needed to\nmake rational decisions about the commissioning of the project is defined, key roles and responsibilities\nare resourced and allocated, and a foundation for detailed planning is available.\nThe purpose of the process of starting up a project is as much about preventing poorly conceived ideas\nfrom ever being initiated as it is about progressing viable projects for approval. As such, starting up a\nproject is a lighter process compared to the more detailed and thorough process of initiating a project.\nThe aim is to do the minimum necessary to decide whether it is worthwhile to even initiate the project.\n13.2 Objectives\nThe objectives of the process of starting up a project are to ensure:\n● There is a business justification for initiating the project (documented in an outline business case).\n● All the necessary authorities exist for initiating the project (for example, to assign people and secure\nresources).\n● Sufficient information is available to define and confirm the scope of the project (in the form of a\nproject brief).\n● Alternative approaches have been evaluated and the chosen project approach agreed.\n● Individuals are appointed who will undertake the work required in the initiation stage or take\nsignificant project management roles during the project.\n● The work required for the initiation stage (documented in a stage plan) is planned.\n● Time is not wasted initiating a project based on unsound assumptions regarding the project’s scope,\ntimescales, acceptance criteria, or constraints.\n220"

In PRINCE2, the trigger for the project is referred to as\nthe project mandate. This is provided by the responsible authority from the business that is\ncommissioning the project. There is also a wide variety of areas where the responsible authority could\ncome from. For example, the project executive group, a functional or operational unit, a programme, a\nportfolio, or a customer.\nFrom an organizational perspective in PRINCE2, the responsible authority is regarded as being outside\nthe project in the business layer. The term project mandate applies to whatever information is used to\ntrigger the project, such as a feasibility study or the receipt of a request for proposal in a supplier\nenvironment. The project mandate should provide the terms of reference for the project and should\ncontain sufficient information to identify at least the prospective project executive of the project board.\nThe information in the project mandate is refined to develop the project brief.\n221"

In such cases, the project manager should validate what is provided by the programme\nand, if necessary, recommend modifications.\nThe preparation of the outline business case and the assembling of the project brief, which are parallel\nand iterative activities, require regular and frequent interaction and consultation between the project\nmanager, the project board members, and other stakeholders. The more time spent on clearly\ncapturing the requirements during the process of starting up a project, the more time will be saved\nduring project initiation and delivery by avoiding issues, exceptions, and replanning.\nTable 13.1 Inputs, activities, and outputs for starting up a project\nInput\nActivities\nOutput\nProject mandate (triggers\nthis process)\nAppoint the project executive and project\nmanager\nDaily log (create)\nPrevious lessons reports\n(review)\nAssess previous lessons\nLessons log (create)\nPrepare the outline business case\nProject product description (create)\nAppoint the project management team\nProject brief (create)\nOutline business case (create)\nSelect the project approach\nAssemble the project brief\nPlan the initiation stage\nRequest project initiation\nStage plan (create for initiation stage)\nProject initiation request (triggers the process\nof directing a project)\n13.4 Activities\n13.4.1\nAppoint the project executive and project\nmanager\nTo get anything done in the project, a decision-maker with appropriate authority (the project executive),\nwho represents the interests of the business stakeholder, is needed.

These lessons may include weaknesses or strengths of the processes and procedures, as\nwell as the techniques and tools used, when they were used, how they were used, and by whom. The\ndesign of the project management team, the outline business case, the contents of the project brief,\nand the stage plan for the initiation stage can be influenced by lessons from previous projects.\nIt may be useful to hold a workshop as a means to capture relevant lessons. Attendees could include\nany interested parties and people who have worked on previous similar projects. If the business has not\ndone this type of project before, it may be helpful to include people external to the business who have\nthe relevant experience.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Review related lessons of similar previous projects of the business and external organizations to\nidentify lessons that can be applied to this project (for example, these may include the results of\naudits and project reviews).\n● Consult with individuals or teams with experience of similar projects.\n● If appropriate, create the lessons log and record any lessons identified and associated actions.\n13.4.3 Prepare the outline business case\nGiven the information available, the outline business case is likely to be only a high-level view at this\ntime. It provides an agreed foundation for a more detailed business case developed in the process of\ninitiating a project (see Chapter 5).\nRecommended actions:\n● The project executive develops the outline business case in accordance with the project mandate\nand based on what is currently known about the project. This is in consultation with the senior user\nif appointed at this time. They will need to understand how the project will contribute towards the\nbusiness objectives.\n● The project manager consults with the senior user, senior supplier, and project executive to define\nwhat the project is to deliver and create the project product description (see Chapter 7).\n● Any risks captured in the daily log are reviewed, and the key risks affecting viability of the project are\nsummarized in the outline business case.\n13.4.4 Appoint the project management team\nThe project needs the right people in place with the authority, responsibility, and knowledge to make\ndecisions in a timely manner. The project management team needs to reflect the interests of all parties\nwho will be involved, including business, user, and supplier interests (see Chapter 6 for a breakdown of\nthe recommended roles within the project management team). It is important that in addition to the\nauthority, responsibility, and knowledge mentioned above, those involved can work together to form a\nhigh-performing team (see Chapter 3).\nIt is essential in a well-run project that every individual involved in the management of the project\nunderstands and agrees who is accountable to whom for what, who is responsible for what, and what\nthe reporting and communication lines are.\n223"

For example, can the project product be delivered incrementally,\nperhaps using agile working methods, or will it need to be delivered in a linear-sequential way?\n● How will the project approach support any sustainability expectations or requirements?\nThe way in which the work is to be conducted will depend on any user or supplier standards, practices, and\nguidelines (such as any specific delivery methods that may apply). These should be captured in the project\nbrief as part of the project approach, as they will influence the management approaches to be created in\nthe process of initiating a project. Capturing these aspects also ensures that the project approach is clearly\nunderstood between the user and the supplier and does not jeopardize the project in any way.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Evaluate the possible delivery solutions and determine the project approach appropriate to\ndelivering the project product and achieving the outline business case.\n● Define any requirements to tailor the method, if known at this time.\n● Use the project log to record any new issues or risks.\n13.4.6 Assemble the project brief\nAn agreed project brief ensures that the project has a commonly understood and well-defined starting point.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Confirm the current status of the project\n● such as the project background and any preparation work performed to date.\n● Confirm the objectives and desired outcomes.\n● Confirm the project scope, exclusions, and project tolerances.\n● Identify any constraints and assumptions.\n● Identify the user and any other known interested parties.\n224"

The work should be planned and approved to\nensure that initiation is not aimless and unstructured. If the project is part of a programme, the end\ndate for the initiation stage should be checked against the date defined in the programme’s plans. The\nstage plan for the initiation stage will also give the programme management team warning of any\nrequirements from the programme.\nThe application of PRINCE2 processes during the initiation stage needs to be considered as part of the\nprocess of starting up a project. For example, the project may choose to apply the controlling a stage\nand managing product delivery processes during the process of initiating a project.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Decide suitable management controls for the initiation stage activities, based on the project approach.\n● Identify any constraints on time and costs for the initiation stage and produce the stage plan for this\nstage according to the principles and techniques in Chapter 7.\n● Review any risks in the project log and assess their impact on the stage plan for the initiation stage. If\nany new risks are identified (or existing ones have changed), update the project log.\n13.4.8 Request project initiation\nTo finish the process of starting up a project, the project manager contacts the project board to request\nproject initiation.

The project board manages by exception. It monitors\nvia reports and controls through a small number of decision points. There should be no need for other\nprogress meetings for the project board, as the project manager will inform the board of any exception\nsituation. It is also important that levels of authority and decision-making processes are clearly defined\nand empower the project manager and team managers.\nThere needs to be a two-way flow of information between the project board and the business layer\nduring the project. The project board must ensure that the project always remains aligned with the\nbusiness layer’s strategy.\nA key role of the project board is to engage with the business layer and act as a communication channel.\nThe requirement for the project board to act as a communication channel, and how it is going to do this\nshould be documented in the communication management approach.\nThe project board should provide unified direction and guidance to the project manager. If the project\nboard is unable to provide a single view, then the risk of project failure significantly increases, as the\nproject manager may act on contradictory requirements and priorities. In such cases, the project\nexecutive makes the decision.\nThe process of directing a project provides a mechanism for the project board to meet its responsibility\nfor ensuring there is continued business justification without being overburdened by hands-on project\nmanagement activity. It also provides a mechanism to avoid the project board micromanaging the\nproject manager.\nOne of the functions of the project board is to provide informal advice and guidance as well as formal\ndirection to the project manager. This is two-way, with the project board updating the project manager\non matters external to the project and the project manager seeking advice whenever necessary during\nthe course of the project.\n231"

The project board activity to authorize initiation ensures such investment is\nworthwhile.\nWhen a request to initiate a project is received from the project manager (following the process of\nstarting up a project), the project board must decide whether to allow the project to proceed to the\ninitiation stage. This may be done either with or without a formal project board meeting or without a\nformal meeting, as long as all members are in agreement, and the project manager is given documented\ninstruction from the project executive to proceed with initiation. The project board may delegate\nproject assurance by instructing a person or group to undertake some of the reviewing and assessing\nactions (such as inspecting the initiation stage plan to confirm it is viable). Where project assurance\nactivities are delegated, the project board remains accountable.\n232"

The need for consultation between the project manager and project board is likely to\nbe especially frequent during the initiation stage and when approaching stage boundaries.\nOngoing direction may be given collectively or by individual project board members. There are a variety\nof circumstances that trigger ongoing direction, including:\n● general advice on the project (for example, explaining the business’ sustainability objectives and ESG\nreporting requirements relevant to the project)\n● responding to requests (for example, when options need clarifying or where areas of conflict need\nresolving)\n● responding to reports (for example, highlight reports, exception reports, and issue reports)\n● responding to external influences (such as changes in business priorities)\n● project board members’ individual concerns\n● responding to changes in project board composition (which may also require business approval).\nIf an exception has occurred during the stage, the project board may request that the project manager\nproduces an exception plan for the project board’s approval. Only exceptions to stage plans need to be\nescalated for approval by the project board; deviations from the project plan need business approval.\nWork package level exceptions are managed by the project manager using the process of controlling a\nstage (see Chapter 16). If approved, the exception plan will replace the plan that is in exception and will\nbecome the new baselined plan.\nIt is also possible that the business revises the project mandate in response to events external to the\nproject or instructs the project board to close the project. The project board has two primary options\nshould the business decide to change the project mandate:\n● Treat it as a request for change (see Chapter 10), asking the project manager to replan the stage or\nproject.\n● Stop, trigger a premature close (see Chapter 19), and then start a new project to meet the changed\nproject mandate. This may result in additional costs compared with the request-for-change option.\nThe project board may delegate project assurance by instructing a person or group to undertake some\nof the reviewing and assessing actions, such as inspecting a request for change to confirm that the\nimpact has been adequately assessed. Where project assurance activities are delegated, the project\nboard remains accountable. When making decisions, it is important to consider the impact on all\nstakeholders (as identified in the communication management approach).\nRecommended actions for the project board:\n● In response to informal requests for advice and guidance, seek advice (if needed) and assist the\nproject manager.\n● In response to an escalated issue (see Chapter 10), seek advice (if needed) and make a decision. If\nthe issue is off-specification then the response is either to reject it, which means the project\nmanagement team or supplier will need to complete the relevant product, or to grant a concession,\nwhich means the incomplete product is accepted.\n● In response to an exception report (see Chapter 11), seek advice (if needed) and make a decision.\n● In response to the receipt of a highlight report (see Chapter 11), review and take actions as necessary.\n● In response to advice and decisions from the business, notify the project manager of any changes.\n234"

There is a risk\nthat the team is not fully released for new work.\nAuthorizing closure of the project is the last activity undertaken by the project board, prior to its own\ndisbandment, and may require endorsement from the business.

Project controls can include:\n● the frequency and format of communication between and within the project management layers\n(see Chapter 6)\n● the number of stages (see Chapter 7)\n● mechanisms to capture and analyse issues (see Chapter 10)\n● setting tolerances for delegated authority (see Chapter 10)\n● how delegated authority from one level of management to another will be monitored (see\nChapter 11)\n● mechanisms to escalate exceptions (see Chapter 11).\nMany of these controls would have been defined in the management approaches but not necessarily\nestablished. The focus of this activity is to establish such controls and to make sure that they make\nsense as a coherent set.\nRecommended actions for the project manager and project support:\n● Confirm the delivery method (linear-sequential, iterative-incremental, hybrid), and assess its\nimplications for project controls.\n● Review how PRINCE2 will be tailored and included in the project initiation documentation and its\nimplications for project controls.\n● Review the management approaches to identify which controls need to be established.\n● Actively seek lessons related to project controls from similar previous projects, business, and\nexternal organizations: some may have been captured in the project log.\n● Review the project log for risks and issues associated with project controls. (The aggregated set of\nrisks will have an impact on the scale and rigour of control activities.)\n● Confirm and document the stage boundaries required to provide the appropriate level of control.\n● Allocate the various levels of decision-making required within the project to the most appropriate\nproject management level.\n● Establish any decision-making procedures that may be appropriate, possibly by tailoring procedures\nwithin an existing quality management system or other standard procedures.\n● Build the agreed decision-making authority and responsibility into the project management team\nstructure and role descriptions where appropriate; this may include finalizing any roles not\npreviously allocated, reallocating roles previously filled and, if necessary, redesigning the project\nmanagement team to include all needed stakeholders and to build a coherent team (see Chapter 3\nand Chapter 6).\n● Confirm the tolerances for the project and the escalation procedures (from team managers to\nproject manager, project manager to project board, and project board to business).\n● Summarize the project controls in the project initiation documentation.\n● Consult with project assurance to check that the proposed project controls are consistent with the\nnature of the project and meet the needs of the project board or business.\n● Update the project log if any new risks or issues are identified (or existing ones have changed).\n● Seek the project board’s approval for the project controls (the board may review them later as part\nof the project initiation documentation).\n244"

This information is held in the project plan and is needed so that the\nbenefits management approach can be prepared, and the project board can control the project.\nPlanning is not an activity that the project manager performs in isolation but something that should be\ndone with close involvement of the users and suppliers to co-create the project plan. It is often useful to\nhold planning workshops to help identify all the products required, their details, and the dependencies\nbetween them.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Confirm the delivery method (linear-sequential, iterative-incremental, hybrid), and assess its\nimplications for planning.\n● Review the project brief to understand scope and any planning requirements.\n● Review how PRINCE2 will be tailored for the project and included in the project initiation\ndocumentation and its implications for planning.\n● Seek lessons related to planning from similar previous projects, business, and external\norganizations. (Some of these may already have been captured in the project log.)\n● Review the project log for risks and issues associated with planning.\n● Identify any planning and control tools to be used by the project, and document how they will be\nused in the project plan.\n● Choose the methods of estimating for the project’s plans.\n● Review the management approaches to understand the resources, standards, methods, and costs\nfor the work to be performed.\n● Create a product breakdown structure for the project product and its major components, write\nproduct descriptions for these, and devise a product flow diagram (include them all in the project\nplan).\n● Identify the arrangements for the transition of the project product into operational use. (If the\nproject product is likely to require maintenance when operational, then plan for a suitable service\nagreement should be drawn up between the support group and the user; in such instances, it will be\nnecessary to include any agreement as a product in the project plan.)\n● Consider whether the project product description needs to be updated (for example, if the\nunderstanding of the acceptance criteria has changed or been refined in the course of initiating the\nproject).\n● Create or update the product register records in the project log for each product to be delivered by\nthe plan.\n● Identify and confirm people and resources required.\n● Confirm the selected people’s availability, their acceptance of these roles, and their commitment to\nexecute them (see Chapter 6 for more details).\n● Identify the activities, resources, people, and timings for the project controls and include them in the\nplan.\n● Document and decide the format and presentation of the project plan, bearing in mind the audience\nfor the plan and how it will be used (for example, it may be sufficient to use a product checklist for\npresenting the plan to the project board).

The full business case will be used by the project board to authorize the project and\nprovides the basis of the ongoing check that the project remains viable. (For more details on business\njustification, see Chapter 5.)\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Review the project brief to check whether there are any business requirements for the format and\ncontent of a business case.\n● Seek lessons related to business case development from similar previous projects, business, and\nexternal organizations. (Some of these may already have been captured in the project log.)\n● Create a more detailed business case with the additional detail gained.\n● Update the project log if any new risks or issues are identified (or existing ones have changed).\n● Consult with project assurance to check that the proposed business case meets the needs of the\nproject board or business.\n● Seek the project board’s approval for the business case (although the project board may prefer to\nreview them later as part of the project initiation documentation).\n15.4.6 Assemble the project initiation documentation\nThere needs to be a focal point at which all information relating to the what, why, who, how, where,\nwhen, and how much of the project is:\n● gathered for agreement by the key stakeholders\n● available for guidance and information for those involved in the project.\nThis information is collated in the project initiation documentation. The project initiation documentation\nis an aggregation of many of the management products created or updated during initiation and used\nto gain authorization for the project to proceed. It is not necessarily a single document but a collection\nof documents or other forms of information (such as a workbook or contents of a project management\ntool).\nThe version of the project initiation documentation created during the process of initiating a project and\nused to gain authorization for the project to proceed must be baselined and should be placed under\nchange control. It will be used later as a means to compare the project’s actual performance against the\noriginal forecasts that formed the basis of approval.\n246"

Corrective action is triggered while\nevaluating the stage status (section 16.4.4) and typically involves handling advice and guidance received\nfrom the project board and issues raised by team managers.\nFor more details on planning, see Chapter 7; for more details on issue management, see Chapter 10.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Collect any relevant information about the deviation.\n● Identify potential solutions for the deviation, and select the most appropriate option.\n● Trigger corrective action via authorizing a work package (see section 16.4.1).\n● Update the product register records of the affected products, including whether any changes are\nrequired or new products are required.\n● Update the issue report (if necessary) to show the status of the corrective action.\n● Update the project log with any changes resulting from the corrective action.\n● Update the stage plan for the current stage.\n16.4.7 Escalate issues and risks\nA stage should not exceed the tolerances agreed with the project board. The project manager can only\ntake corrective action or maintain the status quo as long as the stage (or project) is forecast to be\ncompleted within the tolerances set by the project board. This activity applies where any corrective\naction within the project manager’s control would not save the stage from going beyond the tolerances\nagreed. This applies to all types of issue and risk (or aggregations of them) that cannot be resolved\nwithin the tolerances set by the project board.\n257\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n1\n6\n-\nC\no\nn\nt\nr\no\nl\nl\ni\nn\ng\na\ns\nt\na\ng\ne"

Therefore, the project manager may wish to execute this\nactivity in two steps: an early notification of the forecast exception situation to the project board so that\nthey are prepared, followed by the supporting information in an exception report.\nThe project manager should execute any decision by the project board in response to the escalation.\nEscalating issues and risks is good practice and should not be seen as failure; the earlier that issues are\nescalated, the more time is available to implement any corrective actions.\nFor more details on management of risk, see Chapter 9; for more details on issue management, see\nChapter 10; for more details on exception management, see Chapter 11.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Examine the stage plan to define the extent of the deviation and the unfinished products and to\ndetermine what would happen if the deviation was allowed to continue.\n● Understand the psychological safety within the project management team to decide if actions are\nrequired.\n● Examine the project plan for the project status and the overall effect of any deviation (using the\ncurrent baseline of the project initiation documentation).\n● Determine the options for recovery, and assess them against the business case.\n● Assess the impact of the options for recovery against the stage plan for the current stage.\n(Consideration should be given to the availability of individuals or groups with the skills or experience\nto assess the impact.)\n● Put the situation, options, and the recommendation for a course of action to the project board in an\nexception report; the project board will then decide an appropriate course of action (which may\nsupport or otherwise reject the project manager’s recommendation).\n16.4.8 Report highlights\nThe project manager must provide the project board with summary information about the status of the\nstage and project and distribute other information to the stakeholders at a frequency documented in\nthe communication management approach, as defined by the project board. (See Chapter 11 for more\ndetails on progress controls.)\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Assemble the information from the checkpoint reports, project log, and any significant revisions to\nthe stage plan for the current reporting period (the information is gained from the review of the\nstage status; see section 16.4.4).\n● Assemble a list of corrective actions (as noted or recorded in the project log) undertaken during the\nreporting period; this will assure the project board that the project manager is acting within the\nagreed tolerances (the information is gained from taking corrective action; see section 16.4.6).\n● Review the highlight report for the previous reporting period.\n● Produce the highlight report for the current reporting period.\n● Distribute the highlight report (see Chapter 11). For projects using an iterative-incremental delivery\nmethod such as agile, the highlight report may be based on a ‘pull’ system, whereby the project\nboard looks at progress charts being maintained by the project manager and development teams.\n258"

      "content": "Controlling a stage\n16.5 Applying the process\n16.5.1 General considerations\nThe work package descriptions are fundamentally important to this process, as they relate to PRINCE2’s\nprinciple to focus on products.\nA work package description may vary in detail depending on the relationship between the business and\nthe supplier. It is good practice to include extracts from, or simply make cross-reference to elements of,\nthe project plan, stage plan, or project initiation documentation. This can reduce duplicate content.\nThe relationship between the project manager, project support, and team managers during the\ncontrolling a stage process should be collaborative. The project manager is not delegating or assigning\ntasks to team managers or project support but rather facilitating the process to improve ownership and\nenable the team manager and project support to deliver their contribution to the project, and\nultimately, the business objectives (see Chapter 3 on co-creation and collaboration).\n16.5.2 Tailoring roles in controlling a stage\nThe project manager is responsible for the creation of all new management products in this process but may\ndelegate tasks to others while retaining responsibility. For example, PRINCE2 shows the project manager as\nresponsible for creating work package descriptions. However, in practice, they may not have the requisite\nskills to define specialist products or method statements in the work package description. Hence, they will\nrely on the team manager or other specialists to create the content, and the project manager’s role will be to\nensure that they are defined, reviewed, and assured sufficiently to meet the needs of the stage plan.\n16.6 Responsibilities\nTable 16.2 summarizes the accountability and responsibility for completing each activity in the process\nalong with who should be consulted and informed.\nTable 16.2 RACI chart for controlling a stage\nActivity\nBusiness\nlayer\nProject\nexecutive\nSenior\nuser\nSenior\nsupplier\nProject\nmanager\nTeam\nmanager\nProject\nassurance\nProject\nsupport\nAuthorize a work package\nEvaluate work package status\nReceive completed work package\nEvaluate stage status\nCapture issues and risks\nTake corrective action\nEscalate issues and risks\nReport highlights\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nR\nR\nA\nR\nR1\nA1/R3\nR\nR\nC\nC\nR\nC\nR2\nR4\nI\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nR – Responsible; A – Accountable; C – Consulted; I – Informed\nR1: Responsible to capture issues and risks at stage level\nR2: Responsible to capture issues and risks at team level\nA1: Accountable for corrective actions taken by team manager\nR3: Responsible for own corrective actions\nR4: Responsible for corrective actions at team level\nC\nC\nI\nC\nC\nI\nI\nC\n259\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n1\n6\n-\nC\no\nn\nt\nr\no\nl\nl\ni\nn\ng\na\ns\nt\na\ng\ne"

The role of the team manager is to coordinate\nan area of work that will deliver one or more of the specialist products that form the project product.\nTeam managers can be internal or external to the organization running the project.\n17.2 Objectives\nThe objectives of the process of managing product delivery are to ensure that:\n● Work on products allocated to the team is authorized and agreed.\n● Team managers and their teams are clear as to what is to be produced and what is the expected\neffort, cost, and timescales.\n● The planned products are delivered to quality expectations and within the tolerances.\n● Accurate progress information is provided to the project manager at an agreed frequency to manage\nexpectations.\nTeam managers should receive enough freedom from the project manager to do their work and deliver\nwhat is asked for. This should be formalized by the tolerances as established in the work package\ndescription and the project manager’s trust in the team manager (see Chapter 3). Micromanagement\nfrom the project manager will not improve the project, instead it is more likely to create frustration and\ndelays.\n262"

It is therefore important that monitoring and\ncontrol of specialist work uses controls and measures that are appropriate to the methods and\ntechniques being used. The project manager and team manager should agree with such controls,\ninclude them in the work package description, and ensure that they are compatible with the\nmanagement approaches established for the project.\nWork packages are not necessarily small in scale. All the PRINCE2 principles are as applicable to a work\npackage as to a project, requiring appropriate governance and control and often needing a team\nmanager who is skilled in project management.\nFor large work packages, a team manager may create a hierarchy of smaller work packages to allocate to\nthe team members. In this case, the process for managing product delivery should be tailored to ensure\nthe work in any lower-level work packages is controlled.\nThe relationship between the team manager and their team members during the process of managing\nproduct delivery should be collaborative. The team manager is not delegating or assigning tasks to team\nmembers but rather facilitating the process to improve ownership and enabling them to deliver their\ncontribution to the work package or team plan and ultimately the project and business objectives (see\nChapter 3 on co-creation and collaboration).\n17.5.2 Tailoring roles in managing product delivery\nThe team manager is responsible for all activities but may be supported by team members.

In such cases, it is important to have a\nmechanism for corrective action to bring the project back in the right direction and under control.\nA positive decision not to proceed is not failure. However, providing insufficient information that\nprevents the project board from making an informed decision is a failure, as it may lead to a wrong\ndecision or an unnecessarily delayed decision.\nThe process of managing a stage boundary provides a means by which an exception procedure can be\nimplemented.\nTable 18.1 Inputs, activities, and outputs for managing a stage boundary\nInputs\nActivities\nOutputs\nStage boundary approaching (triggers this\nprocess)\nProject initiation documentation (review)\nProject plan (review)\nProject log (check)\nException plan request (triggers this\nprocess)\nException report (review)\nProject initiation documentation (review)\nProject plan (review)\nProject log (check)\nProject log (check)\nStage plan (check)\nProject plan (review)\nProject plan (check)\nProject log (check)\nBusiness case (review)\nProject log (check)\nPrepare the next stage plan\nProject log (update)\nStage plan (create for next stage)\nProduct descriptions (create for next stage)\nProject initiation documentation (update, if\nnecessary)\nPrepare the exception plan (if\nrequired)\nProject log (update)\nException plan (create)\nProduct descriptions (create/update for the\nrevised stage)\nException plan approval request (triggers the\nprocess of directing a project)\nUpdate the project plan\nProject plan (update, if required)\nUpdate the business case\nBenefits management approach (update, if\nrequired)\nBusiness case (update, if required)\nEvaluate the stage\nEnd stage report (create)\nCommunication management approach\n(check)\nEnd stage report\nRequest the next stage\nStage plan or exception plan (for next stage)\nNext stage request (triggers the process of\ndirecting a project)\n18.4 Activities\n18.4.1 Prepare the next stage plan\nThe stage plan for the next stage is produced near the end of the current stage.

The environment external to the project changes as\ndoes the development of the project product. Therefore, the business case needs to reflect these\nchanges and must be reviewed and amended to keep it relevant to the project.\nAs the project executive is accountable for the business case, the project manager should consult with\nthem when reviewing and updating the business case in preparation for the project board’s approval.\n(See Chapter 5 for more details on business justification.)\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Check whether there have been any changes to the risk appetite and risk capacity of the\norganizations involved and whether risk tolerances need to be redefined.\n● Assess the project’s risks using the project log to ascertain the aggregated risk exposure for the\nproject, and identify the current key risks that affect the business case. This should include an\nassessment that the aggregated risk exposure remains within risk tolerances.\n● Update the benefits management approach with the results from any benefits management actions\nundertaken during the stage.\n● Examine and review the project plan to see whether the final implementation date of the project has\nchanged to an earlier or later date, which might affect some or all of the projected benefits.\n● Check and update the project log as necessary.\n● Revise the business case and, if necessary, the benefits management approach, ready for the project\nboard’s approval.\n18.4.5 Evaluate the stage\nThe results of a stage should be reported back to the project board so that progress is clearly visible to\nthe project management team.\nThe project manager gives a view on the continuing ability of the project to meet the project plan and\nbusiness case and assesses the overall risk situation. This activity should happen as close as possible to\nthe actual end of a stage.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Based on the performance of the stage using the updated business case, updated project plan,\nproject logs, and any updated management approaches, prepare an end stage report for the current\nstage.\n274\nC\nh\na\np\nt\ne\nr\n1\n8\n-\ni\nM\na\nn\na\ng\nn\ng\na\ns\nt\na\ng\ne\nb\no\nu\nn\nd\na\nr\ny"

In such circumstances, the project manager must ensure that work-in-progress is not\nsimply abandoned but that the project salvages anything of value created to date and checks that any\ngaps left by the cancellation of the project are raised to the business.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Update the project log (and, if necessary, the issue report) to record the premature closure request.\n● Update the project plan with actuals from the final stage.\n● Request the product status from project support. From this, determine which of the project\nproduct’s components:\n● have been approved by the authorities identified in their product descriptions\n● are currently in development (and which of those need to be completed)\n● are covered by approved concessions\n● are yet to be started\n● need to be made safe\n● may be useful to other projects.\n● If appropriate, agree the means for recovering products that have been completed or are in\nprogress. This will need the project board’s consultation and may include additional work to create,\nmake safe, or complete products that might be useful to other projects (for example, making an\nunfinished building safe and weatherproof). In some cases, the additional work may require an\nexception plan.\n● Seek approval to give notice to the business that resources and people can be or are about to be\nreleased early.\n19.4.3 Confirm project acceptance\nThe project products must be passed to an operational and maintenance environment prior to the\nproject closure. This may happen as a single release at the end of the project, or the project approach\nmay include a phased delivery where products are delivered in several releases. In the case of a\npremature closure, there may be some products that have been approved but not yet delivered.\nDepending on the project board’s guidance, the ownership of some or all of those products may need\nto be transferred to the users.\nWhen delivering products, the benefits management approach may need to be updated to include the\npost-project benefits review or reviews of the performance of the project product in operational use.\nSuch benefits reviews may identify whether there have been any side effects (beneficial or adverse) that\ncould provide useful lessons for other projects.\nThere may be multiple handovers throughout the project lifecycle.

Format examples are provided, but these are not\nexhaustive.\nManagement products should be applied and tailored to the requirements and environment of each\nproject. This could include the composition, format, quality criteria, and naming of the management\nproducts. For example:\n● Management products can be in other formats and do not necessarily need to be ‘text documents’.\nThey could be slides, spreadsheets, or data in information systems, which are brought together,\neither on screen or as outputs to form reports.\n● Reports do not need to be documents. They could be emails, notes of meetings, wall charts or an\nentry in a daily log. Where verbal reports are used, the information would be incorporated in other\nreports.\n● Management products can be combined for simpler projects where the products fulfil related\npurposes.\n● Management products can be split into smaller parts if it makes them easier to use and maintain.\n● Parts of the composition that are not relevant to the project can be added to or removed, or\nelements can be combined. The composition is not a table of contents, rather it is simply a list of\nwhat the product should typically cover, and therefore the order of the topics may be changed.\n● The product description outlines in this appendix may be tailored to an organization to create its\nown set of outlines that would form part of its own PRINCE2-based project management method.\nThere are three types of management product: baselines, reports, and records.\nBaseline management products are those that define aspects of the project, and when approved, are\nsubject to change control. These are:\n● A1 Business case\n● A9 Plan (covers project plan, stage plans, exception plans and, optionally, team plans)\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\ni\nx\nA\n-\nM\na\nn\na\ng\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\nP\nr\no\nd\nu\nc\nt\ns\n● A10 Product description\n● A11 Project brief\n● A12 Project initiation documentation\n● A14 Project product description\n● A15 Work package description\n286"

Sustainability tolerance is documented in the\nbusiness case. See tolerance.\ntailoring\nAdapting a method or process to suit the situation in which it will be used.\nteam manager\nThe person responsible for the production of products allocated by the project manager (as defined in\na work package description) to an appropriate quality, timescale, and a cost acceptable to the project\nboard. This role reports to, and takes direction from, the project manager. If a team manager is not\nassigned, the project manager undertakes the responsibilities of the team manager role.\nteam plan\nA plan used as the basis for organizing and controlling the work of a team when executing a work\npackage. Team plans are optional in PRINCE2.\nthreat\nAn uncertain event that could have a negative impact on objectives or benefits.\ntime\nThe period over which the project will run and the period over which the benefits will be realized.\ntimebox\nA finite period of time when work performed to achieve a goal or meet an objective. The deadline\nshould not be moved, as the method of managing a timebox is to prioritize the work inside it. At a low\nlevel, a timebox will be a matter of days or weeks (for example, a sprint). Higher-level timeboxes act as\naggregated timeboxes and contain lower-level timeboxes (for example, stages).\ntime-driven control\nA management control that takes place at predefined periodic intervals. For example, this could be\nproducing highlight reports for the project board or checkpoint reports showing the progress of a work\npackage.\n331\nl\nG\no\ns\ns\na\nr\ny"

The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out\nthrough ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical\ncommittee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International\norganizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work.\nISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of\nelectrotechnical standardization.\nThe procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are\ndescribed in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular, the different approval criteria needed for the\ndifferent types of ISO documents should be noted.

In addition to ongoing operations, project, programme and portfolio management\nprovide an integrated management framework to deliver value. Projects, programmes and portfolios\nexist within the organizational environment and the organization exists within the larger external\nenvironment.\nFigure 1 illustrates that opportunities and threats can be identified through organizational strategy and\nobjectives. The opportunities and threats can be evaluated and further developed into requirements\nand business cases. Based on those business cases and using portfolio management or another\nmanagement structure, the organization selects and authorizes projects and programmes that provide\ndeliverables, outputs and outcomes to operations. When used in operations, deliverables, outputs and\noutcomes should contribute to realizing benefits for internal and external stakeholders. The benefits\ncan also contribute to further development of the organization's strategy and objectives.\n© ISO 2021 – All rights reserved\n3"
